In Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, 189 U.S. 71, 75
(1903), this Court held that a federal court "can accord
[a state judgment] no greater efficacy" than would the
judgment-rendering State. That holding has been
adhered to on at least three occasions since that time.
Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co.,
309 U.S. 4, 7-8 (1940); Wright v. Georgia Railroad &
Banking Co., 216 U.S. 420, 429 (1910); City of
Covington v. First National Bank, 198 U.S. 100, 107-109
(1905). The Court has also indicated that the States are
bound by a similar rule under the Full Faith and Credit
Clause. Public Works v. Columbia College, 17 Wall.
521, 529 (1873). The Court is thus justified in this case
to rule that preclusion must be determined under state
law, even if there would be preclusion under federal
standards.
This construction of 28 U. S. C. 
ยง
 1738 and its
predecessors is unfortunate. In terms of the purpose of
that section, which is to require federal courts to give
effect to state-court judgments, there is no reason to
hold that a federal court may not give preclusive effect
to a state judgment simply because the judgment would
not bar relitigation in the state courts. If the federal
courts have developed rules of res judicata and collateral
estoppel that prevent relitigation in circumstances that
would not be preclusive in state courts, the federal
courts should be free to apply them, the parties then
being free to relitigate in the state courts. The contrary
construction of 
ยง
 1738 is nevertheless one of long
standing, and Congress has not seen fit to disturb it,
however justified such an action might have been.
Accordingly, I join the opinion of the Court.
