In 1979, officials from the Idaho Department of Fish &
Game observed the respondents Lester and Conrad
Gissel and Dave and John Lewis harvesting wild rice on
land jointly owned by the state and the National Forest
Service. After further observations, the department
notified the county prosecutor who obtained a warrant
to search Lester Gissel's residence. The search revealed
180 bags of wild rice weighing approximately 50 pounds
each which the state seized. David Lewis and Lester and
Conrad Gissel were subsequently charged and convicted
of trespass. The case against John Lewis, a juvenile, was
dismissed. The district court set aside the jury verdict
against the respondents, but was reversed on appeal by
the Idaho Court of Appeals. State v. Gissel, 105 Idaho
287, 668 P.2d 1018 (Ct.App.1983). On remand, the
prosecutor dismissed the charges against the
respondents.
Prior to the criminal trial, the respondents' attorney and
the county prosecutor stipulated that the wild rice itself
need not be entered into evidence and agreed to the sale
of the rice in order to keep it from perishing. The rice
was sold, although the record is inconsistent as to
whether the sale price was $9,000 or $16,000.
On December 24, 1979, respondents filed a Notice of
Claim to the wild rice or its proceeds against the State of
Idaho. The state denied liability. On February 24, 1981,
the respondents filed a complaint against the state
alleging the state negligently seized and disposed of the
rice and had failed to account to the respondents for the
proceeds thereof.
A civil trial before Judge Prather was held on December
18, 1984. The court took judicial notice of the evidence
adduced at the criminal trial and heard additional
testimony and arguments. On March 8, 1985, the
district court issued its Memorandum Opinion in which
respondents were awarded one-half of the stipulated
value of the rice ($10,500). Judgment was entered and
the state's subsequent motion to amend the
Memorandum Opinion, which constituted the court's
findings of fact and conclusions of law and the
judgment, was denied on June 4, 1985. The state now
appeals.
The defendant-appellant, State of Idaho, raises two
issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in
finding a factual basis for a 50/50 division of ownership
of the wild rice between the State of Idaho and the
United States Forest Service; and (2) whether the
district court erred in holding that the plaintiffsrespondents
the Gissels, were entitled to recover the
proceeds of the sale of the wild rice they harvested from
the U.S. Forest Service land.
I
The state argues that the district court's factual finding
of a 50/50 division of ownership of the land from which
the rice was gathered and, therefore, a 50/50 division of
the proceeds of the sale of the rice, is not supported by
the facts produced at trial. Factual findings of a trial
court "will not be reversed unless the finding is clearly
erroneous or not supported by substantial and
competent evidence." I.R.C.P. 52(a). Jensen v. Bledsoe,
100 Idaho 84, 593 P.2d 988 (1979); Courtright v.
Robertson, 99 Idaho 575, 586 P.2d 265 (1978); Shrives v.
Talbot, 91 Idaho 338, 421 P.2d 133 (1966). Evidence
produced at trial clearly indicates that the wild rice was
gathered from land belonging to both the U.S. Forest
Service and the State of Idaho. The Gissels testified that
they knew the land where they gathered the rice
belonged to the Forest Service and the State. Al
Brunner, a former employee of the Department of Fish
and Game, who worked in that area and had knowledge
of the lands and its ownership, testified that he believed
the rice was gathered from Forest Service land and state
land in quantities amounting to the 50/50 split. Based
on this evidence, [727 P.2d 1155] the district court
concluded that the respective share of ownership was
50/50. The findings of the trial court are not clearly
erroneous and are supported by substantial and
competent evidence.
The trial court's acceptance of the stipulated valuation of
the rice at $21,000 is also supported by substantial and
competent testimony. The harvest produced 180 bags of
rice, 50 pounds green weight, and when dried the
weight was reduced to 25 pounds. The selling price was
$5.15 a pound, which totals $23,175. Excluding costs,
and other factors, the parties stipulated the value to be
$21,000. The record presents no evidence to mistrust
the $21,-000 amount agreed by the parties. The fact that
the amount received from the sale is disputed to be
either $9,000 or 16,000 has no bearing upon the
valuation of the rice for purposes of this appeal.1
The district court correctly held that the Gissels were
entitled to recover only the amount of $10,500
attributable to National Forest Service land, since the
other $10,500 was gathered from state land and
rightfully belonged to the state.
II
The second issue raised on appeal by the state is whether
the district court erred in permitting the Gissels to
recover from the state the value of the rice attributable
to the National Forest Service land.
The district court found that the Gissels are entitled to
recover from the state because it unlawfully converted
part of the proceeds from the sale of the rice when it
refused to account for the amount it received for the rice
attributable to the U.S. Forest Service land. Conversion
is "any distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over
another's personal property in denial or inconsistent
with his rights therein, such as a tortious taking of
another's chattel, or any wrongful exercise ... over
another's goods, depriving him of the possession,
permanently or for an indefinite time." Klam v. Koppel,
63 Idaho 171, 118 P.2d 729 (1941). Conversion is an
intentional exercise of dominion or control over a
chattel which so seriously interferes with the rights of
another to control it that the actor may justly be
required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.
Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 222A, (1965). The
state's refusal to account for the money received
unlawfully interferred with the Gissels' possessory
rights.
The state argues that it is not required to account for the
proceeds of the sale as the Gissels could never have
acquired any possessory right to entitle them to the
proceeds. The state correctly points out that "one who
steals or converts property to his own use does not
thereby acquire title thereto." Stewart v. People, 193
Colo. 399, 566 P.2d 1069 (1977); First National Bank
and Trust Company of Lincoln v. Ohio Casualty
Insurance Company, 196 Neb. 595, 244 N.W.2d 209
(1976); Northern Insurance Company of New York v.
Miller, 129 N.W.2d 28 (Iowa 1964). But these cases are
not controlling here. In each of the cited cases, the
parties alleging the conversion were the true owners or
assignees. Therefore, it was held that the thief or the
party who had converted the property to his own use or
someone who had acquired property from the thief or
converter of the property, could not gain title or retain
possession of the property as against the true owner,
and in each case the property was returned to the true
owner or assignee.
By contrast, in the case at bar, the Gissels do not seek
the return of property which rightfully belonged to the
state—but only that portion which belonged to the
Forest Service. The Gissels, as prior possessors, have a
superior right as against the state to possession of the
proceeds attributable to Forest Service land. In
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 895, (1965), it [727
P.2d 1156] states, "One who is otherwise liable to
another for harm to or interference with land or chattel
is not relieved of the liability because a third person has
a legally protected interest in the land or chattel superior
to that of the other." See also, Thomsen v. State, 70
Wn.2d 92, 422 P.2d 824 (1966). Mere possession alone
is sufficient to sustain a trespassor's cause of action for
conversion against all but the true owner. New England
Box Co. v. C & R Const. Co., 313 Mass. 696, 49 N.E.2d
121 (1943); Welke v. Davenport, 309 N.W.2d 450 (Iowa
1981); Associates Discount Corporation v. Gillineau,
322 Mass. 490, 78 N.E.2d 192 (1948); Adams v. Queen
Insurance Company of America, 88 So.2d 331
(Ala.1956); Novak v. State, 195 Md. 56, 72 A.2d 723
(1950). See also, Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Lewis, et al.,
162 U.S. 366, 16 S.Ct. 831, 40 L.Ed. 1002 (1896).
The Gissels trespassed upon land belonging to the state
and the U.S. government. Idaho Fish and Game officers
seized the rice with a valid search warrant when the
Gissels were arrested for trespassing. The state, under
stipulation of both parties, then sold the rice and
retained possession of the share attributable to U.S. land.
This share of the proceeds belongs to the U.S.
government and not to the state. The failure of the state
to account for the proceeds of the sale constitutes a
conversion by the state. The Gissels, though trespassors
and without legal title, which title rests with the Forest
Service, still by mere possession have greater rights
superior to that of the state, and the Gissels are,
therefore, entitled to recover that share of the money,
$10,500, which belongs to the Forest Service.
The state has brought to the attention of this Court the
statutory provisions regarding the disposal of property
stolen or embezzled and not claimed by the owner. See,
I.C. §§ 193801-3805. As previously discussed, the owner
of the lands and the rice gathered from those lands
belongs to the State and the Forest Service. However,
the Forest Service never put in a claim for the rice
grown on its land, and the Gissels were never convicted
of stealing or embezzling the rice. The Gissels made a
timely claim for the return of the proceeds of the sale
from the Forest Service lands and, the State cannot rely
upon I.C. § 19-3801 through I.C. § 19-3805 to justify its
actions in not accounting for the proceeds of the sale
and returning that share which, for the purposes of this
appeal, belongs to the Gissels.2
The state's second argument is based upon the theory
that it was acting as an agent for the Forest Service and
was thereby authorized to sell the rice and retain
possession of the proceeds for the benefit of the Forest
Service.
Agency is a fiduciary relationship in which the principal
confers authority upon the agent to act for the principal.
Restatement (Second) of Agency §§ 1 & 7 (1957).
Agency can be established in three ways. First, real
authority—an expression by the principal, either written
or oral, granting authority to the agent to act, Clark v.
Gneiting, 95 Idaho 10, 501 P.2d 278 (1972); Thornton v.
Budge, 74 Idaho 103, 257 P.2d 238 (1953); Gorton v.
Doty, 57 Idaho 792, 69 P.2d 136 (1937). Second, implied
authority—the principal acts in such a manner which
leads the agent to believe that he has authority to act for
the principal. Adkinson Corp. v. American Bldg. Co.,
107 Idaho 406, 690 P.2d 341 (1984); State v. DeBaca, 82
N.M. 727, 487 P.2d 155 (1971). Third, apparent
authority—acts by the principal involving third parties
who are conversant with the business practices of the
principal, whereby a reasonable person would be lead to
believe that the agent has authority to act for the
principal. Clements v. Jungert, 90 Idaho 143, 408 P.2d
810 (1965); Commercial Insurance Co. v. Hartwell
Excavating Co., 89 Idaho 531, 407 P.2d 312 (1965);[727
P.2d 1157] Anderson v. Smith Frozen Foods of Idaho,
Inc., 83 Idaho 494, 365 P.2d 965 (1961).
The party alleging the existence of an agency
relationship carries the burden of proof. Transamerica
Leasing Corp. v. Van's Realty Co., 91 Idaho 510, 427
P.2d 284 (1967); Hayward v. Yost, 72 Idaho 415, 242
P.2d 971 (1952). "Where the existence of an agency
relationship is disputed, it is a question for the trier of
fact to resolve from the evidence." Clark, supra at 12,
501 P.2d at 280.
The state points to a document which it alleges supports
its position that an agency relationship existed. That
document is a Memorandum of Understanding between
the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the Forest
Service. The memorandum does not contain any express
references conferring authority upon the state indicating
an agency relationship. Nor is there any evidence of
actions between the Forest Service and the state which
could lead to an inference that the state had implied
authority to act for the Forest Service. And finally, the
record does not show any activities by the Forest Service
which would indicate to the Gissels that the state was
acting as an agent for the Forest Service. The
memorandum only outlines policies of cooperation
between the Forest Service and the Department of Fish
and Game. It does not expressly or inferentially confer
any authority upon the state to act as an agent.
The final piece of evidence upon which the state relies
to support its agency argument is a signed stipulation
between the state and the Gissels. The stipulation states,
"2. The U.S. Forest Service, claiming an interest in
approximately one-half of the wild rice, refuses to
release its interest to other than the Idaho Department
of Fish and Game." (Emphasis added.) Stipulation and
Order, at 1, (Tr. on Appeal, Vol. 1, at 14-15, Supreme
Court No. 13921), State of Idaho v. Gissel, Nos.
M26354, M26357, M26356, M26355, (1st D. Idaho,
October 2, 1979), reprinted in Gissel v. State, Supreme
Court No. 16107. The stipulation merely states that the
Forest Service would not release its claim to anyone but
the state; it does not confer any authority, real or
implied, upon the state to act for the Forest Service. The
state has failed to meet the burden of showing the
existence of an agency relationship and the record
supports the district court's finding that no agency
relationship existed. The district court heard the
evidence, assessed the reliability and the weight of the
witnesses' testimony, and found that the state was not
the agent of the Forest Service. We, therefore, affirm
the district court's decision.
