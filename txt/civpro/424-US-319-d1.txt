For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in
Richardson v. Wright, 405 U.S. 208, 212 (1972), I agree
with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that,
prior to termination of benefits, Eldridge must be
afforded 
[424 U.S. 350]
 an evidentiary hearing of the
type required for welfare beneficiaries under Title IV of
the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. 
ยง
 601 et seq. See
Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970). I would add that
the Court's consideration that a discontinuance of
disability benefits may cause the recipient to suffer only
a limited deprivation is no argument. It is speculative.
Moreover, the very legislative determination to provide
disability benefits, without any prerequisite
determination of need in fact, presumes a need by the
recipient which is not this Court's function to denigrate.
Indeed, in the present case, it is indicated that because
disability benefits were terminated there was a
foreclosure upon the Eldridge home and the family's
furniture was repossessed, forcing Eldridge, his wife,
and their children to sleep in one bed. Tr. of Oral Arg.
39, 47-48. Finally, it is also no argument that a worker,
who has been placed in the untenable position of having
been denied disability benefits, may still seek other
forms of public assistance.
