I concur in the majority opinion, except to note that
Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S.
365, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978) does not
entirely resolve the issue of the applicability of Finley v.
United States, 490 U.S. 545, 109 S.Ct. 2003, 104 L.Ed.2d
593 (1989) to this matter.
In speaking with approval of ancillary jurisdiction in
cases of third party actions, Owen was referring to
impleader under Rule 14. Such third party actions, by
their very nature, logically depend upon the underlying
law suit. Owen, 437 U.S. at 376, 98 S.Ct. at 2404. The
case at bar differs from the impleader described in Owen
in that 417 Fifth's alleged liability to Towers, [920 F.2d
1127] which is to be asserted pursuant to a Rule 13(h)
joinder to a counterclaim, does not logically depend
upon Towers' alleged liability to Associated.
Nonetheless, if not a logical dependency, there is a
logical relationship and an intertwining between
Towers' proposed claim against 417 Fifth and the
underlying action. That is, the claim against the landlord
is logically related to and intertwined with claims based
on the sublease because of the necessity to construe the
landlord's consent to sublease. The consent to sublease
was part of the Associated-Towers contractual
arrangement, which is the essence of the dispute.
One should not read Owen to establish a rigid test for
ancillary jurisdiction based on logical dependence.
Although it does not address joinder to a compulsory
counterclaim, Owen has been viewed as representing a
flexible approach to ancillary jurisdiction, at least in the
area of defendant's joinder of additional claims. See King
Fisher Marine Service v. 21st Phoenix Co., 893 F.2d
1155, 1162-63 (10th Cir.) cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 110
S.Ct. 2603, 110 L.Ed.2d 283 (1990) (logically related
claim added against a non-diverse third party impleaded
under Rule 14.)
Neither Owen nor Finley address directly jurisdiction
over new parties ancillary to a compulsory
counterclaim. The pre-Finley Second Circuit decisions
on this issue, however, do enable resolution of claims
that are inextricably enmeshed in resolution of the
dispute between the parties to the primary action. See
Newburger Loeb & Co. v. Gross, 563 F.2d 1057, 1070
(2d Cir.1977), cert. denied 434 U.S. 1035, 98 S.Ct. 769,
54 L.Ed.2d 782 (1978); United Artists Corp. v.
Masterpiece Prods. Inc., 221 F.2d 213 (2d Cir.1955).
Finley should not be read so broadly as to upset a
flexible approach to ancillary jurisdiction in a case such
as the one at hand.
