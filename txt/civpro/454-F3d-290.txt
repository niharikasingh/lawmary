Appellants, current and former Navy chaplains of "nonliturgical
Protestant" faiths and their endorsing agency,
brought suit alleging the Navy has unconstitutionally
established and maintained a religious quota system for
the promotion, assignment, and retention of Navy
chaplains that disadvantages chaplains of non-liturgical
Protestant faiths. In the midst of discovery, Appellants
moved for preliminary and structural injunctions and
for partial summary judgment. The district court denied
the motion in its entirety, finding, in particular, that
Appellants had failed to demonstrate the irreparable
injury necessary to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.
We affirm the district court as to its denial of a
structural injunction, and we have no jurisdiction to
review its denial of partial summary judgment; however,
because we conclude Appellants have satisfied the
requisite showing of irreparable harm for an
Establishment Clause violation, we vacate the district
court's judgment denying preliminary injunctive relief
and remand for the district court to proceed with the
remainder of the preliminary injunction determination.

The United States Navy maintains a Chaplain Corps to
"meet the spiritual needs of those who serve in the Navy
and their families." Adair v. England, 183 F.Supp.2d 31,
35 (D.D.C.2002) (citation and internal quotation mark
omitted). Chaplains serve as Naval officers and, like
other military officers, both regular and reserve, receive
periodic reviews by promotion selection boards that
determine which officers should be recommended for
promotion. Id. at 35-36; 10 U.S.C. §§ 611, 14101. Any
officer a promotion selection board considers but does
not recommend for promotion is deemed to have "failed
of selection" (FOS) to the higher grade. 10 U.S.C. §§
627, 14051. The military may convene a special selection
board for officers who were erroneously not considered
by a promotion selection board, or who were considered
but did not receive lawful or proper consideration. Id.
§§ 628, 14502; SECNAV Instruction 1401.1B, Special
Promotion Selection Boards for Commissioned and
Warrant Officers in the Navy and Marine Corps ¶ 4(b)
(Dep't of the Navy Apr. 25, 1997).
Federal law mandates separation from military service
based on criteria relating to age, grade, and failures of
selection. In general, naval reserve officers who have not
been recommended for promotion to the grade of rear
admiral (lower half) must be separated from the military
on the last day of the month they reach 60 years of [454
F.3d 294] age.1 10 U.S.C. § 14509. The Secretary of the
Navy is afforded some flexibility to deviate from this
rule, however. Provided a reserve officer in the
Chaplain Corps has not twice failed to be promoted to
the next higher grade, the Secretary may retain the
chaplain until age 67. Id. § 14703(a)(2). Ordinarily, a
second FOS makes separation mandatory, e.g., id. §§
14505-14506, but even officers who would otherwise be
precluded from further service for having twice failed of
selection may, "subject to the needs of the service," be
considered for continuation under regulations
prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, id. § 14701(a)(1);
SECNAV Instruction 1920.7B, Continuation on Active
Duty of Regular Commissioned Officers and Reserve
Officers on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) in the
Navy and Marine Corps (Dep't of the Navy Jan. 30,
2006); DoD Directive 1320.8, Continuation of Regular
Commissioned Officers on Active Duty and Reserve
Commissioned Officers on the Reserve Active Status
List (Dep't of Defense Oct. 21, 1996).2 Chaplains
retained under this continuation exception may also
serve until age 67. SECNAV Instruction 1920.7B ¶ 8;
DoD Directive 1320.8 ¶ 4.9.
The Secretary of the Navy has issued instructions
describing the qualifications for eligibility as a Chaplain
Corps officer. "To be eligible for appointment . . . in
either the active-duty or Reserve components, or for
voluntary recall from the Reserve component to the
active-duty list," an applicant must, among other
requirements, "be able to complete 20 years of active
commissioned service by age 60," a benchmark that may
be raised to age 62 in certain instances. SECNAV
Instruction 1120.4, Appointment of Regular and
Reserve Officers in the Chaplain Corps of the Navy ¶
6(b) (Dep't of the Navy May 14, 1986). Applicants who
will be unable to complete 20 years of active
commissioned service by age 60 must, before their
appointment, acknowledge in writing that they are
ineligible for appointment to regular service. Id. ¶ 6. In
addition, applicants who will be unable to complete 20
years of creditable service for retirement must similarly
acknowledge the same in writing. Id.
The Navy divides its chaplains into four categories
according to common faith group characteristics:
Catholic, liturgical Protestant, non-liturgical Protestant,
and "special worship." "Liturgical Protestant" refers to
Protestant denominations that trace their origins to the
Reformation, retain an established liturgy in their
worship services, and practice infant baptism; it includes
Lutheran, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and
Congregational faiths. Adair, 183 F.Supp.2d at 36.
"Nonliturgical Protestant" refers to Protestant
denominations that do not have a formal liturgy or
order in their worship services, that baptize only those
who have reached the age of reason, and whose clergy
generally do not wear religious vestments during
services; it includes Baptist, Evangelical, Pentecostal, and
Charismatic faiths. Id.; see also In re England, 375 F.3d
1169, 1172 (D.C.Cir.2004).3
Plaintiffs-Appellants are a group of current and former
Navy chaplains of nonliturgical Protestant faiths and
their recognized endorsing agency, the Chaplaincy of
Full Gospel Churches.4 They filed two separate suits
against the Secretary of the Navy and other Navy
personnel in their official capacities and the Navy itself,
Appellees here. In both actions, Appellants alleged "the
Navy has established, promoted, and maintained
religious quotas and other discriminatory practices in
the Navy Chaplain Corps in violation of the First and
Fifth Amendments," In re England, 375 F.3d at 1174,
and these practices work to the detriment of nonliturgical
Christian chaplains. In 2000, the district court
consolidated the two cases for the purpose of addressing
and resolving pretrial motions. Mem. Op. Den. the Pls.'

F.Supp.2d 196 (D.D.C. 2002); Adair, 183 F.Supp.2d at
31; see also Mem. Op. at 2 (describing the case's
"wearisome, piecemeal litigation").
The instant appeal stems from the district court's denial
of Appellants' latest motion, filed in the midst of
discovery. Appellants' Interrogatory No. 9 requested a
list of chaplains on active duty over age 62 and their
denominations. From the Navy's response, Appellants
identified fifteen Catholic reserve chaplains over age 62,
fourteen of whom are lieutenants or lieutenant
commanders who have twice failed of selection and yet
remain on active duty. Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Pls.'
Mot. for a Prelim. and Structural Inj. and Partial Summ.
J. 8 (June 5, 2003) (Pls.' Mem.); Appellants' Br. 11.
Appellants also identified seven of these FOS Catholic
chaplains as age 67 or greater. Pls.' Mem. at 8.
Armed with this evidence, Appellants moved for
preliminary and structural injunctions and partial
summary judgment. Appellants contended the age 60
ceiling established by 10 U.S.C. § 14509 prohibits the
Navy from allowing the identified reserve lieutenant
and lieutenant commander chaplains over age 62 to
remain on active duty. Id. Even if the chaplains
remained in service past age 60 under 10 U.S.C. § 14703,
Appellants argued, the Navy violated [454 F.3d 296] that
provision's absolute age limit of 67 by retaining seven
chaplains of or over that age. Id. Appellants also
maintained that none of the chaplains over age 62
possessed sufficient time in service to qualify for
retirement and the resulting pension, id., and that the
Navy gave those chaplains over age 67 a "4109"
personnel classification, meaning "retired reservist
recalled to active duty," even though none of them
possessed the requisite time in service to qualify for
retirement and for the Navy legally to recall them. Id. at
9.5
The Navy's actions, in Appellants' words, evidence a
"well established practice of allowing Catholic Naval
Reserve chaplains, and only Catholic chaplains," to
remain on active duty beyond mandatory separation age
limits, constituting "religious favoritism" in violation of
the Establishment Clause. Id. at 1-2. Appellants also
accused the Navy of "fraud in covering up this illegal
retention" by wrongfully employing the "4109"
classification with respect to Catholic chaplains over age
67. Id. at 1. The Navy's "scheme," according to
Appellants, "appears on its face to have no other
purpose but to allow these over-age chaplains to illegally
qualify for retirement." Id. Appellants sought relief that
would, among other things, "require the Navy to
separate immediately those chaplains it has allowed to
continue on active duty beyond age 60." Id. at 22.
The district court denied the motion in its entirety. The
district court first rejected preliminary injunctive relief
because Appellants failed to demonstrate any irreparable
injury. Mem. Op. at 5. In so doing, it repudiated
Appellants' argument that violation of the law, including
the First Amendment and, specifically, the
Establishment Clause, per se constitutes irreparable
harm. Id. at 6-7. The district court then denied partial
summary judgment because adequate time for discovery
had not passed. Id. at 8. Appellants timely appealed.
II
We begin on a brief jurisdictional note. We have
jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of
preliminary injunctive relief, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1);
however, as a general rule, we lack jurisdiction to hear
an appeal of a district court's denial of summary
judgment, partial or otherwise. E.g., Johnson v. Greater
Se. Comm. Hosp. Corp., 951 F.2d 1268, 1277
(D.C.Cir.1991). Appellants offer no reasons to deviate
from this principle, so we confine the remainder of our
analysis to the district court's denial of the requested
preliminary injunction.6
[454 F.3d 297] "The purpose of a preliminary injunction
is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties
until a trial on the merits can be held." Univ. of Tex. v.
Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68
L.Ed.2d 175 (1981). It is "an extraordinary remedy that
should be granted only when the party seeking the
relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of
persuasion." Cobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 258
(D.C.Cir.2004). To warrant preliminary injunctive
relief, the moving party must show (1) a substantial
likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would
suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not
granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially
injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public
interest would be furthered by the injunction. E.g.,
Mova Pharm. Corp., 140 F.3d 1060, 1066
(D.C.Cir.1998) (quoting CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of
Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C.Cir.1995))
(internal quotation marks omitted). A district court
must "balance the strengths of the requesting party's
arguments in each of the four required areas." CityFed,
58 F.3d at 747. If the showing in one area is particularly
strong, an injunction may issue even if the showings in
other areas are rather weak. Id. Despite this flexibility,
though, a movant must demonstrate "at least some
injury" for a preliminary injunction to issue, id. (quoting
Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1078
(D.C.Cir.1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted), for
"the basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has
always been irreparable harm," Sampson v. Murray, 415
U.S. 61, 88, 94 S.Ct. 937, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974) (quoting
Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506,
79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959)) (brackets and
internal quotation marks omitted). A movant's failure to
show any irreparable harm is therefore grounds for
refusing to issue a preliminary injunction, even if the
other three factors entering the calculus merit such
relief. See, e.g., Sea Containers Ltd. v. Stena AB, 890
F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (D.C.Cir.1989).
We review a district court's weighing of the four
preliminary injunction factors and its ultimate decision
to issue or deny such relief for abuse of discretion,
though any legal conclusions upon which the district
court relies, including whether Appellants have
demonstrated irreparable injury, are reviewed de novo.
Mova Pharm. Corp., 140 F.3d at 1066; Transohio Sav.
Bank v. Dir., Office of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598,
614 (D.C.Cir.1992).
A
This court has set a high standard for irreparable injury.
First, the injury "must be both certain and great; it must
be actual and not theoretical." Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC,
758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.Cir.1985) (per curiam). The
moving party must show "[t]he injury complained of is
of such imminence that there is a `clear and present'
need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm."
Id. (citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks
omitted). Second, the injury must be beyond
remediation. As we have stated:
The key word in this consideration is irreparable. Mere injuries,
however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy
necessarily expended in the absence of a stay are not enough. The
possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief
will be available at a later date, in the ordinary [454 F.3d 298] course
of litigation weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.
Id. (quoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass'n v. FPC, 259
F.2d 921, 925 (D.C.Cir.1958)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
Appellants fail to articulate a tangible injury that is
either "certain and great" or irreparable. Appellants
argue the Navy's allegedly unlawful practice of retaining
Catholic chaplains past applicable age limits precludes
non-liturgical Protestant chaplains from advancing to
higher grades, since Congress and the Navy cap the
number of officers per grade. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 523(a)(2),
12011(a)(2); Decl. of Captain Lyman M. Smith 2 (noting
that Congress provides an annual authorization of
officers by grade, which the Navy further breaks down
by community, for example, Chaplain Corps). Such an
injury is far too speculative to warrant preliminary
injunctive relief. At most, the Navy's purported practice
reduces Appellants' opportunities for promotion, which
are themselves dependent upon the number of Chaplain
Corps vacancies Congress and the Navy authorize each
year. Appellants perhaps inadvertently reveal the
hypothetical nature of their tangible injury when they
refer to "the ultimate relief which would eventually
follow resolution of these cases, e.g., possible
promotions." Appellants' Reply Br. 20 (emphasis added).
This statement underscores the absence in this
proceeding of any discrete injury that is "of such
imminence" that equitable relief is urgently necessary.
In addition, Appellants' asserted tangible injury is
redressable. The Navy is authorized to convene special
selection boards to review a previous non-promotion.
10 U.S.C. §§ 628, 14502; SECNAV Instruction 1401.1B.
Within the reserves, the Navy may convene such a
board if an "officer or former officer" failed to receive a
promotion selection board's recommendation because,
among other reasons, the initial board acted "contrary to
law" or its action "involved [a] material error of fact." 10
U.S.C. § 14502(b)(1)(A); SECNAV Instruction 1401.1B
¶ 8(a)(1)-(2). If the special selection board recommends
the promotion of a current officer, that officer "shall, as
soon as practicable, be appointed to the next higher
grade" and "shall, upon such promotion, have the same
date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and
allowances of that officer's grade, and the same position
on the active duty list [or] the reserve active status list . .
. that officer would have had" if the original promotion
selection board had correctly recommended the officer
for promotion. 10 U.S.C. § 14502(e)(1)-(2); SECNAV
Instruction 1401.B ¶ 14. Former officers who prevail
before the special selection board are entitled to revision
of their military record "to correct an error or remove
an injustice resulting from not being selected for
promotion" by the initial board. 10 U.S.C. § 14502(e)(3).
Monetary remedies are available to such officers "if, as a
result of correcting a record, [an] amount is found to be
due." Id. § 1552; see also, e.g., Marsh v. Johnson, 263
F.Supp.2d 49, 51 (D.D.C.2003) (describing correction of
record and back payment award to retired officer after
special selection board's reversal of previous failure to
recommend for promotion). These measures ensure
that, should the courts eventually conclude the Navy has
an unlawful practice of retaining Catholic chaplains past
applicable age limits to the detriment of non-liturgical
Protestant chaplains, "adequate compensatory or other
corrective relief" is available to Appellants, belying their
claims of irreparable tangible harm at this point.
B
Having failed to assert a tangible injury that constitutes
irreparable harm, [454 F.3d 299] Appellants are left to
argue that the Navy's alleged violation of the
Establishment Clause per se constitutes irreparable
harm. The district court rejected this proposition, but
we disagree.
Appellants' argument that they would suffer irreparable
harm without a preliminary injunction rests on a
statement by a three-Justice plurality in Elrod v. Burns,
427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976)
(plurality opinion), that "[t]he loss of First Amendment
freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,
unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Id. at
373., 96 S.Ct. 2673 Because Appellants claim Appellees'
practice of retaining overage Catholic chaplains
constitutes an impermissible denominational preference
in violation of the Establishment Clause, they urge us to
apply the language of the Elrod plurality on its face and
conclude that Appellants have demonstrated irreparable
injury — specifically, the harm that flows from the
"forbidden message" of marginalization Appellees'
actions send to Appellants. Appellants' Br. 20. They note
several of our sister circuits have employed Elrod to find
irreparable harm where moving parties alleged a
violation of the Establishment Clause — in other words,
the precise context in which we find ourselves. See
ACLU of Ky. v. McCreary County, 354 F.3d 438, 445
(6th Cir.2003), aff'd on other grounds, ___ U.S. ___, 125
S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005); Ingebretsen v.
Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist., 88 F.3d 274, 280 (5th Cir.1996);
Parents' Ass'n of P.S. 16 v. Quinones, 803 F.2d 1235,
1242 (2d Cir.1986).
Appellees, in contrast, maintain Elrod is inapposite
because that case involved political speech and
expression, a context far removed from the
Establishment Clause allegations Appellants advance.
They also assert the rationale underlying the Elrod
plurality's statement was a concern that without
preliminary injunctive relief, the First Amendment
rights to speech and expression would be "chilled"
during the pendency of litigation, a harm that could not
be redressed after final judgment. Appellees maintain
Appellants have not identified any constitutionally
protected behavior that may be chilled in the absence of
a preliminary injunction; accordingly, they claim, the
concerns motivating the Elrod plurality are not present
here and Appellants' mere allegations, without more, do
not support a finding of irreparable injury.
At first blush, Appellees appear to have the better of this
debate. Elrod involved political speech and freedom of
expression. There, Republican patronage employees of a
county sheriff's department brought suit against, among
others, a newly elected county sheriff who was a
Democrat. Elrod, 427 U.S. at 350, 96 S.Ct. 2673
(plurality opinion). At the time, it was common for an
incoming sheriff of a different political party to replace
non-civil-service employees with members of his own
party when the existing employees lacked or failed to
obtain requisite support from, or failed to affiliate with,
the new sheriff's political party. Id. at 351, 96 S.Ct. 2673.
The Elrod plaintiffs alleged they had been discharged, or
threatened with discharge, solely for these reasons and
claimed a violation of, inter alia, the First Amendment.
Id. at 350, 96 S.Ct. 2673. Upon review, a plurality
consisting of Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall,
with Justice Brennan writing, held, after lengthy
discussion, that patronage dismissals are
unconstitutional under the First Amendment and that
plaintiffs had therefore stated a claim. Id. at 373, 96 S.Ct.
2673. The plurality then briefly turned to whether a
preliminary injunction was warranted, a determination
that hinged upon whether plaintiffs had made out an
irreparable injury. [454 F.3d 300] Concluding they had,
the plurality stated:
It is clear . . . that First Amendment interests were either threatened
or in fact being impaired at the time relief was sought. The loss of
First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,
unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury. See New York Times
Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822
(1971). Since such injury was both threatened and occurring at the
time of [plaintiffs'] motion and since [plaintiffs] sufficiently
demonstrated a probability of success on the merits, the Court of
Appeals might properly have held that the District Court abused its
discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief.
Id. at 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673. In a footnote to this
passage, the plurality noted, "The timeliness of political
speech is particularly important." Id. at 374 n. 29, 96
S.Ct. 2673.7
The facts of Elrod, which involved dismissals from
government jobs for failure to ascribe to or gain the
approval of a political party; the plurality's citation to
New York Times, a landmark free expression case; and
the footnote stressing the "timeliness of political speech"
make evident that the pertinent Elrod language on
which Appellants rely is directed toward circumstances
concerning freedom of expression. Indeed, in almost all
of the many subsequent cases in which our sister circuits
have invoked the Elrod plurality's statement, the
operative First Amendment liberties allegedly violated
were variants of expressive liberties, such as the rights
to speak, associate, petition, or exercise one's religion.
See, e.g., Pac. Frontier v. Pleasant Grove City, 414 F.3d
1221, 1235 (10th Cir.2005); Tucker v. City of Fairfield,
398 F.3d 457, 464 (6th Cir.2005); Joelner v. Village of
Washington Park, 378 F.3d 613, 620 (7th Cir.2004);
Newsom v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd., 354 F.3d 249,
261 (4th Cir.2003); Brown v. Cal. Dep't of Transp., 321
F.3d 1217, 1226 (9th Cir.2003); Tenafly Eruv Ass'n v.
Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 178 (3d Cir.2002);
Iowa Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Williams, 187 F.3d
963, 970 (8th Cir.1999); Bery v. City of New York, 97
F.3d 689, 693-94 (2d Cir.1996); Miss. Women's Med.
Clinic v. McMillan, 866 F.2d 788, 795 (5th Cir. 1989);
Romero Feliciano v. Torres Gaztambide, 836 F.2d 1, 4
(1st Cir.1987); Cate v. Oldham, 707 F.2d 1176, 1188
(11th Cir. 1983). The number of cases applying Elrod to
alleged Establishment Clause violations is comparatively
meager, see McCreary Cty., 354 F.3d at 445; Baker v.
Adams County/Ohio Valley Sch. Bd., 310 F.3d 927, 930
(6th Cir.2002) (per curiam); Ingebretsen, 88 F.3d at 280;
Quinones, 803 F.2d at 1242, and, furthermore, each of
these decisions cites Elrod only in passing, devoid of any
analysis of its particular context. The single court that
focused on Elrod's facts recognized the statement at
issue here "was made . . . in the context of free speech"
and rejected applying it axiomatically to Establishment
Clause claims. ACLU of Ill. v. City of St. Charles, 794
F.2d 265, 274 (7th Cir.1986). Therefore, there is
superficial merit to Appellees' argument [454 F.3d 301]
that Elrod ought to play no role in the proceeding before
us, which turns entirely on establishment claims.
In addition, Appellees accurately note that this court has
construed Elrod to require movants to do more than
merely allege a violation of freedom of expression in
order to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the
preliminary injunction frame-work. Rather, moving
parties must also establish they are or will be engaging
in constitutionally protected behavior to demonstrate
that the allegedly impermissible government action
would chill allowable individual conduct. Thus, for
example, in National Treasury Employees Union v.
United States, 927 F.2d 1253 (D.C.Cir.1991), we refused
to find irreparable harm where federal employees
sought a preliminary injunction after alleging that ethics
laws prohibiting them from making appearances,
delivering speeches, and writing articles for
compensation violated their First Amendment rights.
Id. We noted that while "the loss of First Amendment
freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, may
constitute irreparable injury," id. at 1254 (quoting Elrod,
427 U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673 (plurality opinion))
(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted),
movants must show that their "First Amendment
interests are either threatened or in fact being impaired
at the time relief is sought," id. at 1254-55 (quoting
Wagner v. Taylor, 836 F.2d 566, 577 n. 76
(D.C.Cir.1987) (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct.
2673 (plurality opinion))) (brackets omitted). We
concluded that because the record did not suggest the
plaintiffs would "cease speaking or writing" before the
district court resolved their claims, irreparable harm
would not follow and preliminary relief could not issue.
Id. at 1255. Several other courts have adopted this
approach, which emphasizes that where it is not clear
that a particular statute, policy, or practice will have any
actual adverse effect on protected First Amendment
liberties, the moving party must demonstrate some
likelihood of a chilling effect on their rights. As the
Second Circuit has stated:
Where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that
directly limits speech, the irreparable nature of the harm may be
presumed. . . . In contrast, in instances where a plaintiff alleges
injury from a rule or regulation that may only potentially affect
speech, the plaintiff must establish a causal link between the
injunction sought and the alleged injury, that is, the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the injunction will prevent the feared deprivation
of free speech rights.
Bronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of Educ., 331 F.3d 342,
349-50 (2d Cir.2003); see also Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d
69, 72-73 (3d Cir.1989) ("[T]he assertion of First
Amendment rights does not automatically require a
finding of irreparable injury. . . . Rather the plaintiffs
must show `a chilling effect on free expression.'"
(quoting Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487, 85
S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965))); Am. Postal Workers
Union v. U.S. Postal Serv., 766 F.2d 715, 722 (2d
Cir.1985); cf. Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 & n. 7,
92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972). Accordingly,
Appellees are correct when they assert that in this court,
as in several others, "there is no per se rule that a
violation of freedom of expression automatically
constitutes irreparable harm." Appellees' Br. 23.
But the crucial distinction Appellees fail to recognize,
and which ultimately undermines their position, is that
freedom of expression is not the operative First
Amendment right at issue in this case. It is not the
freedom to speak, to associate, to petition, to exercise
one's religion, or [454 F.3d 302] any other liberty that
protects an individual's freedom to engage in a
particular activity. Rather, the pertinent liberty here is
protection against government imposition of a state
religion or religious preference. This protection, unlike
other First Amendment rights that are variants of the
freedom to express oneself, requires no affirmative
conduct on the part of the individual before its
guarantees are implicated by government action. As a
matter of semantics, an act chills the freedom of an
individual to do something; it is incongruous to link the
concept of "chilling" with an individual's freedom not to
have something done to him. Accordingly, while a
particular government action may chill one's propensity
to speak, associate, exercise one's faith, or otherwise
engage in constitutionally protected individual conduct,
where, as here, the claim asserts government imposition
of a religious preference, the "chilling effect" rationale is
both inapposite and superfluous.
Because of this critical difference, the twin concerns
animating Appellees' argument are much less
determinative than they initially appear. First, while we
have required individuals seeking a preliminary
injunction on First Amendment grounds to demonstrate
a likelihood that they are engaging or would engage in
the protected activity the governmental action is
purportedly infringing, we have done so only in the
context of free expression, where the relevant
constitutional protection is not implicated without some
corresponding individual conduct that faces a danger of
chilling. But the Establishment Clause is implicated as
soon as the government engages in impermissible
action. Where, as here, the charge is one of official
preference of one religion over another, such
governmental endorsement "sends a message to
nonadherents [of the favored denomination] that they
are outsiders, not full members of the political
community, and an accompanying message to adherents
that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community." Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104
S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). This harm, to which Appellants repeatedly
refer throughout their briefs, see, e.g., Appellants' Reply
Br. 9 ("Here the message is the Navy prefers Catholics."),
occurs merely by virtue of the government's purportedly
unconstitutional policy or practice establishing a
religion, without any concomitant protected conduct on
the movants' part. Accordingly, Appellees' reliance on
National Treasury Employees Union and similar cases is
misplaced in proceedings concerning alleged
Establishment Clause violations.
Second, while Elrod arose in the context of political
speech, and its operative language has been employed
almost exclusively with respect to restrictions on free
speech, free exercise of religion, or other variants of
freedom of expression, we think it is also applicable to
purported Establishment Clause violations. We reach
this conclusion not simply by axiomatically applying
Elrod's admonition that "[t]he loss of First Amendment
freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,
unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury," as other
courts have done and Appellants urge. Rather, we
emphasize the language surrounding this maxim and
note its validity with respect to Establishment Clause
claims. The Elrod plurality noted that the plaintiffs'
"First Amendment interests were either threatened or in
fact being impaired at the time" they sought preliminary
injunctive relief, and that because their injury was "both
threatened and occurring" and they showed a
probability of success on the merits, a preliminary
injunction could follow. Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct.
2673 (plurality opinion). [454 F.3d 303] Because, when
an Establishment Clause violation is alleged,
infringement occurs the moment the government action
takes place — without any corresponding individual
conduct — then to the extent that the government
action violates the Establishment Clause, First
Amendment interests are "threatened or in fact being
impaired." Of course, this raises the question of the
extent to which the disputed government action actually
violates the Establishment Clause — but this inquiry is
addressed by another prong of the preliminary
injunction calculation, the likelihood of the movant's
success on the merits. Within the irreparable harm
analysis itself — which assumes, without deciding, that
the movant has demonstrated a likelihood that the nonmovant's
conduct violates the law — we examine only
whether that violation, if true, inflicts irremediable
injury. And because of the inchoate, one-way nature of
Establishment Clause violations, which inflict an
"erosion of religious liberties [that] cannot be deterred
by awarding damages to the victims of such erosion,"
City of St. Charles, 794 F.2d at 275, we are able to
conclude that where a movant alleges a violation of the
Establishment Clause, this is sufficient, without more, to
satisfy the irreparable harm prong for purposes of the
preliminary injunction determination.
Appellees expressly disclaim any contention that
"Establishment Clause violations can never constitute
irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a preliminary
injunction." Appellees' Br. 30. They merely "urge the
Court to reject a per se rule that alleging an
Establishment Clause violation, without anything more,
necessarily constitutes irreparable harm." Id. But this
proposition fails for two reasons. First, we are unable to
identify the pivotal "anything more" that movants
alleging an Establishment Clause violation could offer in
order to demonstrate irreparable harm. In cases
involving purported violations of freedom of speech,
association, religious exercise, or other expressive First
Amendment liberties, we are able to fashion, and have
fashioned, such a line-drawing element: movants must
demonstrate a likelihood that they will engage in the
constitutionally protected expressive conduct. But as
noted, this notion is not translatable to the First
Amendment freedom from government establishment
of religion. The harm inflicted by religious
establishment is self-executing and requires no
attendant conduct on the part of the individual. It is
unclear what, exactly, movants alleging an
Establishment Clause violation could show to
differentiate between establishments that inflict
irreparable harm and those that do not.
Second, and more significant, Appellees' proposed
approach would foreclose all possibility of preliminary
injunctive relief in Establishment Clause cases based on
intangible harm, even those involving the most manifest
violations of the Establishment Clause. Consider, for
example, a state legislature's decision, with gubernatorial
approval, to erect an enormous cross in front of the
statehouse, on public property, using public funds. The
legislative history unambiguously reveals an intent to
raise the cross as a symbol of Christianity and to spread
Christian values among the polity. An offended resident
would have taxpayer standing to seek removal of the
cross, cf. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 105-06, 88 S.Ct.
1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), and would handily win a
permanent injunction to that effect. Under Appellees'
theory, however, she could not possibly obtain a
preliminary injunction ordering removal of the cross
during pendency of the litigation, despite the certainty
with which she would ultimately prevail on the merits
of her claim and the irreparability of the [454 F.3d 304]
harm inflicted upon her in the meantime. Appellees
would have the taxpayer allege something more than a
patent violation of the Establishment Clause; yet we
cannot imagine what that could be. The result would be
an erosion of the very principles of religious freedom
the Establishment Clause serves to safeguard. See City of
St. Charles, 794 F.2d at 275 ("If preliminary injunctions
were not available in cases brought to enforce the
establishment clause, government might be able to
erode the values that the clause protects with a flood of
temporary or intermittent infringements."). We reject
this position and instead hold that a party alleging a
violation of the Establishment Clause per se satisfies the
irreparable injury requirement of the preliminary
injunction calculus.8
We stress that a finding of irreparable injury is but one
of four elements that comprise the preliminary
injunction framework. The mere allegation that the
government is violating the Establishment Clause may
suffice to satisfy the irreparable harm prong, but a
preliminary injunction will not issue unless the moving
party also shows, on the same facts, a substantial
likelihood of success on the merits, that the injunction
would not substantially injure other interested parties,
and that the public interest would be furthered by the
injunction. It is these other prongs that will ultimately
determine meritorious motions for preliminary
injunctions in the face of purported Establishment
Clause violations. Unsupported or undeveloped
allegations of government establishment, for example,
while sufficient to make out irreparable injury, will not
withstand scrutiny concerning the movant's likelihood
of success on the merits, thereby defeating a request for
a preliminary injunction. Likewise, demands for
preliminary relief that inflict untoward detriment on
persons not party to the case will meet a similar fate, as
will motions that do not further the public interest.
Thus we do not believe that our decision today in any
way lessens the burden for parties seeking preliminary
injunctive relief against purported Establishment Clause
violations. It merely focuses greater attention on the
three other factors that indisputably enter into the
preliminary injunction determination.
Appellants allege that Appellees' practice of retaining
overage Catholic chaplains constitutes a denominational
preference in violation of the Establishment Clause. If
true, which we assume is the case for purposes of the
irreparable injury prong, the government has, without
anything more, infringed upon Appellants' freedom
from government establishment of religion, constituting
irreparable harm. The district court committed error in
finding otherwise.
III
Having reached a conclusion contrary to the district
court with respect to Appellants' irreparable injury, we
must decide whether to proceed with the remainder of
the preliminary injunction determination, as Appellants
urge, or remand the case to the district court, as
Appellees insist. We believe the proper course of action
at this point is to remand to the district court.
When denying a preliminary injunction, a district court
"shall . . . set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of
law which constitute the grounds of its action."
Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). "It is of the highest importance to a
proper review of the action of a court in granting or
refusing a preliminary injunction that there [454 F.3d
305] should be fair compliance with Rule 52(a)." Mayo
v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U.S. 310, 316,
60 S.Ct. 517, 84 L.Ed. 774 (1940). The district court here
confined its analysis to determining whether irreparable
harm would visit Appellants without interim relief. It
expressly withheld consideration of the three other
factors that enter into the preliminary injunction
calculus. See Mem. Op. at 5 & n. 2. Accordingly, the
"conclusions of law" as to these other factors that Rule
52(a) requires are not present. See Fair Hous. in
Huntington Comm. Inc. v. Town of Huntington, 316
F.3d 357, 364 (2d Cir.2003); Hoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan
Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 423 (4th Cir.1999)
("Requiring trial courts to explain their injunction
orders serves at least two important purposes. First, it
allows the parties to better understand the reasons for
the court's actions. Second, a written explanation of the
district court's reasoning permits an appellate court to
meaningfully review that decision."); 9A Charles Alan
Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &
Procedure § 2576 (2d ed. 1995) ("If the appellate court
finds that it cannot review the case meaningfully
without findings and conclusions, it may remand so that
findings can be made."). We are therefore disposed to
remand to the district court to pick up where it left off.
We are aware that because our review of the legal
findings supporting a district court's preliminary
injunction determination is de novo, the absence of legal
findings does not necessarily preclude us from
undertaking appellate review. See LGS Architects, Inc.
v. Concordia Homes of Nev., 434 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th
Cir.2006). But our review of the district court's
balancing of the four preliminary injunction factors and
ultimate decision to grant or deny such relief is for abuse
of discretion, and without any conclusions of law as to
the three remaining factors, we are unable to determine
whether the district court properly carried out this
function. See Hoechst Diafoil, 174 F.3d at 423. A
remand would also effect greater development of the
remaining preliminary injunction factors, particularly
Appellants' likelihood of success on the merits, which
we believe advisable. Indeed, in explicitly choosing not
to address the three other components, the district court
noted that if later required to turn to them, it would
"likely benefit" from further elaboration of certain
arguments raised before it concerning the merits of
Appellants' claim. Mem. Op. at 5 n. 2. Both precedent
and prudence, therefore, counsel a remand to the district
court so that a "full understanding of the issues" may be
attained. Six Clinics Holding Corp., II v. Cafcomp Sys.,
Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 400 (6th Cir. 1997); cf. New Comm
Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 13
(1st Cir.2002) ("Injunctive relief is, by its very nature,
fact-sensitive and case-specific. For that reason, the
court of appeals ordinarily will not uphold a preliminary
injunction on a ground that was not fully addressed by
the trial court.").
IV
By alleging that Appellees are engaging in conduct that
violates the Establishment Clause, Appellants have
satisfied the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary
injunction framework. We therefore reverse the district
court on this point, vacate its denial of preliminary
injunctive relief, and remand for the court to carry out
the remainder of the preliminary injunction analysis.
We affirm the district court's denial of structural
injunctive relief, and we have no jurisdiction to rule on
its denial of partial summary judgment.
