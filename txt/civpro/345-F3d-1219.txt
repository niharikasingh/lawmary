The City of Macon, Georgia ("Macon") appeals a
declaratory judgment granted to Alltel
Communications, Inc. ("Alltel") and a permanent
injunction imposed against Macon. In deciding the
ultimate issues of this case, we must first determine
whether the district court properly interpreted and
applied Georgia law. Because the district court
concluded, and the parties agree, that this case involves
issues of Georgia law which have not been directly
decided, we certify a question of law to the Supreme
Court of Georgia and postpone any further
consideration of the appeal in this case until we receive
an answer from that court.
Background
Alltel is a telecommunications company providing
telephone service throughout the United States, using a
network of fiber optic cable. In July 1997, Alltel
contracted with Georgia Power Company for the
purpose of installing fiber optic cable on utility poles
owned and maintained by Georgia Power along city
streets within Macon. Pursuant to the existing
municipal ordinance, Alltel sought and obtained a
permit from Macon on July 4, 1997, authorizing
placement of the fiber optic cable. Alltel installed a total
of 25,555 feet of fiber optic cable. None of the cable was
installed upon the rights-of-way which are under the
direct authority of the Georgia Department of
Transportation. From July 1997 through April 11, 2000,
the City charged a $2.00 per linear foot annual permit
fee under Section 18-153 of Article VII, Chapter 18 of
the Code of Ordinances for Macon. Alltel paid the fees
without objection. The purpose of the ordinance is to
"... govern the compensation charged by the City in its
franchising and licensing of telecommunications
providers and in the City's management of the use of the
public [345 F.3d 1221] right-of-way within the corporate
limits and boundaries of the City."
On July 8, 1999, Macon amended the ordinance,
increasing the permit fee from $2.00 to $4.50 per linear
foot ("the Amended Ordinance"). On April 11, 2000,
Macon submitted an invoice to Alltel for $114,997.50
for one-year fees under the Amended Ordinance. Alltel
has refused to pay this amount, contending that Macon
cannot charge $4.50 per foot but rather is limited to
$5,000 per mile ($0.947 per foot), the rate charged by
the Georgia Department of Transportation on its rightsof-way.
The Proceedings In The District Court
On April 4, 2001, Alltel filed its complaint. Alltel alleged
two counts. In Count I, it charged that the Amended
Ordinance violated the federal Telecommunications
Act, 47 U.S.C. § 253(a), because it assessed a fee which
was not fair and reasonable and because its effect was to
"prohibit" Alltel from providing interstate or intrastate
telecommunications service. In Count II, it alleged that
the Amended Ordinance violated Georgia Code § 34-4-
92 (and related code sections) because it charged more
than the maximum permitted by the Department of
Transportation under Regulation 672-11-03. Alltel
sought a declaratory judgment. Macon filed a
counterclaim for unpaid permit fees.
The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.
On September 27, 2002, the district court entered an
order granting Alltel's motion and concluding that
under Georgia Code § 32-4-92(a)(10), Macon's
Amended Ordinance was invalid because it is
"preempted by state law" and charges a rate that exceeds
that charged by the Georgia Department of
Transportation (D.O.T.). The court enjoined Macon
from enforcing the Amended Ordinance.
Both sides agree that the standard of review is de novo.
Positions of Parties
Macon's Position
Section 32-4-92(a)(10) and its cross-reference to § 32-6-
174 are intended to address only technical issues such as
installation, construction, maintenance, removal, etc.,
and do not limit a municipality's right to charge a
revenue producing and licensing fee. There is no
authority directly on point. However, the statute reads:
A municipality may grant permits and establish reasonable
regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal,
removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires,
[345 F.3d 1222] poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other
equipment, facilities, or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over,
or under any part of its municipal street system and of a county
road system lying within its municipal limits. However, such
regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities
affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the
department with respect to utilities on the state highway system
under authority of Code Section 32-6-174.
Ga.Code Ann. § 32-4-92(a)(10)(2002)(emphasis added).
All the terms of the statute focus on technical matters.
Under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, the naming of a
word is to be determined from the accompanying word.
See Haddon v. Shaheen & Co., 231 Ga.App. 596, 499
S.E.2d 693, 695 (1998) (citations omitted). Also, under
the doctrine expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the
expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others.
See In re Copelan, 250 Ga.App. 856, 553 S.E.2d 278, 287
(2002). Under these canons of statutory construction, it
is clear that the "permit" authorized by the statute deals
with installation, construction, etc., and nothing more.
Georgia Code § 32-6-174, which is referenced in the
statute at issue, was also passed as part of the 1973
legislation. It contains the same "technical" language
found in the statute at issue. At the time the statutes
were passed, there were no D.O.T. regulations
addressing fees, and the legislature was simply trying to
insure that utilities were not presented with conflicting
responsibilities. For example, the statutes were designed
to keep municipalities and the D.O.T. from requiring
that the same cables be constructed from different
materials. The last sentence of § 32-6-174 reads: "In
addition to the requirements of such department
regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the utility to
obtain whatever franchise is required by law."
Obviously, this statute contemplates that utilities may
have to acquire franchises pursuant to Georgia Code §
36-34-2(7).
The D.O.T. did not intend for its 1985 fee schedule to
limit or affect municipal fees, and if Alltel's
interpretation is correct, the regulation is an invalid
delegation of legislative power. The D.O.T.'s regulations
apply only to the state highway system and roads funded
with federal aid. The fees would apply to all roads if the
regulations were intended to limit a municipality's
power. Nowhere in the regulations is it indicated that
the D.O.T. intended or expected that its fees would
govern what could be charged by a municipality. These
fee regulations are more akin to the state's regulating
power, while the Amended Ordinance is more akin to
the revenue raising power.
As to the separation of powers argument, i.e., that
D.O.T. was supposed to take over a municipality's
taxing/franchising power, Macon notes that a
delegation of legislative power must provide "sufficient
guidelines" to avoid violating the Georgia Constitution.
See Dep't of Transp. v. City of Atlanta, 260 Ga. 699, 398
S.E.2d 567, 571-72 (1990). Further, an administrative
rule that "exceeds the scope of or is inconsistent with the
authority of the statute upon which it is predicated is
invalid." Dep't of Human Res. v. Siggers, 219 Ga.App. 1,
463 S.E.2d 544, 546 (1995) (citation omitted). Georgia
Code § 32-4-92(a)(10) does not indicate whether it is a
"regulatory" power statute or a "revenue-raising" and/or
"franchise" statute as set out in § 36-34-2(7). No
guidance was given about "rural" versus "urban" fee
areas. There are simply no guideposts at all. Thus, if
Alltel's interpretation is correct, there has been an
improper delegation of power.
A statute that is nearly identical to § 32-4-92(a)(10) has
been interpreted in a [345 F.3d 1223] way favorable to
Macon's position. Georgia Code § 32-4-42(6), which
applies to county governments, has the same "technical"
language as the statute at issue. It also references the
D.O.T. fees pursuant to § 32-6-174. In DeKalb County
v. Georgia Power Co., 249 Ga. 704, 292 S.E.2d 709
(1982), the court, interpreting § 32-4-42(6), stated:
DeKalb County is not entitled to extract from the power company a
tax, franchise fee, rental fee, or other charge (however designated)
in return for permission to use the county's road rights-of-way
outside of municipalities for the erection, maintenance and use of
power transmission lines.
Id. at 710. The fact that counties are not entitled to
charge any fee at all under that statute reinforces the
argument that the subject statute only addresses
technical matters. Since it only addresses technical
matters, § 32-4-92(a)(10) was not intended to limit
Macon's franchise power under § 36-34-2(7). Macon
also cites an Attorney General's opinion, which it argues
is consistent with its position.
Macon's power to impose a franchise fee is found in §
36-34-2(7) and is not limited by § 32-4-92(a)(10). The
"franchise" power was enacted in 1963, eleven years
before the statutes at issue. Section 36-34-2(7) states
that municipalities have the power to "grant franchises
to or make contracts with ... electric light or power
companies, gas companies, steam-heat companies,
telephone and telegraph companies, water companies,
and other public utilities for the use and occupancy of
the streets of the city...." Although not directly on point,
numerous cases have up-held a municipality's right to
charge a franchise fee, specifically under this statute. See,
e.g., Athens-Clarke County v. Walton Elec.
Membership Corp., 265 Ga. 229, 454 S.E.2d 510 (1995);
City of Calhoun v. N. Ga. Elec. Membership Corp., 264
Ga. 205, 443 S.E.2d 469 (1994). In none of these cases
did the court hold, or even suggest, that a municipality's
power is in any way limited by § 32-4-92(a)(10). No
contract is required in order to support a municipality's
exercise of its franchise power. See Athens-Clarke, 454
S.E.2d at 513. Thus, even though Alltel has refused to
follow the Amended Ordinance and sign the permit, it is
still required to pay the fee.
Finally, Macon argues that the substance, and not the
title, of the Amended Ordinance should control. The
Georgia Court of Appeals has held that there is a
difference between a "franchise" and a "license." See City
of LaGrange v. Troup County Elec. Membership Corp.,
200 Ga.App. 418, 408 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1991). Here, the
Amended Ordinance requires a permit, which, at first
blush, arguably suggests something besides the exercise
of the franchise power. However, the "distinction
between a tax and a license is not one of names but of
substance." DeKalb County v. Atlanta Gas Light Co.,
228 Ga. 512, 186 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1972)(quoting
Richmond County Bus. Ass'n, Inc. v. Richmond County,
224 Ga. 854, 165 S.E.2d 293, 295 (1968)). Here, although
the word "permit" is used, the Amended Ordinance
states that it is an ordinance governing the
"compensation ... in franchising and licensing."
Alltel's Position
Section 32-4-92(a) establishes the power of Georgia
municipalities to regulate the use of municipal rights-ofway
and places limitations on those powers. The
language is clear and unambiguous. The regulations
promulgated by the D.O.T. affect "long distance cables,"
which would clearly include the fiber optic cables at
issue here. The Georgia legislature has given a limited
grant of regulatory power to Georgia municipalities
regarding municipal rights-of-way, [345 F.3d 1224]
which includes the regulation, through permits, of the
installation and maintenance of wires, cables, etc.
Through this system, the legislature has established a
scheme to (a) provide general statewide uniformity in
permit fees affecting telecommunications cables, and (b)
to prevent any municipality from charging excessive
permit fees. Because a municipal ordinance cannot
supersede an act of the legislature, see City of Atlanta v.
Myers, 240 Ga. 261, 240 S.E.2d 60, 63 (1977), the district
court properly enjoined enforcement of the Amended
Ordinance.
The fees at issue are clearly permit fees, not franchise
fees. See Record at Tab 6, Ex. A; Tab 6 at ¶¶ 7, 8, 10, and
13 (Stipulated Facts referring to it as a "permit fee"). The
word "permit" is generally synonymous with the term
"license" and refers to a right granted pursuant to police
and regulatory power. Because the fees are permit fees,
DeKalb County v. Georgia Power Co., 249 Ga. 704, 292
S.E.2d 709 (1982), cited by Macon, would actually
support Alltel's position, i.e., that Macon cannot charge
any fees at all unless authorized by statute, and the
statute places limits on what can be charged. Thus,
although not considered by the district court, DeKalb
County v. Georgia Power Co. provides an alternative
basis for affirming summary judgment.
Alltel also addresses the "separation of powers"
argument and contends that there is no evidence, one
way or the other, of what the D.O.T. intended.
Moreover, because of § 32-4-92(a)(10), the intent of the
D.O.T. is irrelevant. Second, the legislature has
established benchmarks. It has stated that municipalities
are limited to whatever the D.O.T. charges under "any
equivalent regulation." As noted by Macon, this ensures
a uniform operating system for telecommunications
companies. Since these regulations are "equivalent
regulation[s]," summary judgment should be affirmed.
Next, Alltel addresses whether the Amended Ordinance
provides for a "permit" or a "franchise." The Stipulated
Facts state that Macon is imposing a "permit fee." A
"franchise," as contemplated by the legislature, is a
contractual grant of a property right from a municipality
to a grantee. See City of LaGrange, 408 S.E.2d at 710 ("A
franchise is a contract creating property rights.")
(citations omitted). Typically, Alltel contends, "public
utilities ... seek franchise rights from the governing
authority in the area in which it seeks to provide
services to use the streets and public ways for the
purposes of rendering utility services." City of
LaGrange, 408 S.E.2d at 710 (citing Ga.Code Ann. § 36-
34-2(7)). Here, the telephone poles on which Alltel
installed its fiber optic cable were already lawfully
located in the rights-of-way. Alltel did not apply for a
franchise to provide telecommunications utility services
in Macon. Rather, it obtained a permit to locate long
distance trunk lines on established utility poles in the
rights-of-way. Thus, it was seeking a permit, not a
franchise.
Finally, Alltel disputes Macon's assertion that the
Amended Ordinance is some kind of municipal tax.
Alltel cites Camden Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City
of St. Marys, 247 Ga. 687, 279 S.E.2d 200 (1981), in
which the court stated:
We observe that the tax imposed upon the company is a business or
occupation tax because it is measured by a certain category
(recurring local service) of gross revenues, and because it is
imposed upon the operation of the business rather than comprising
a condition [345 F.3d 1225] precedent to engaging in the business (a
license fee).
Id. at 202 (emphasis added). Here, it is undisputed that
the Amended Ordinance is a condition precedent to
engaging in business. See Record at Tab 6, ¶ 13.
Moreover, Macon points to nothing that would allow it
to impose such a tax, citing Camden, 279 S.E.2d at 202
(noting that "the basic power to tax belongs to the state.
For a municipality to possess this power it must be
conferred upon the municipality either directly in the
constitution or by statute.").
Conclusion
The district court concluded, which the parties have not
disputed, that there is no Georgia case law or legislative
history which addresses whether fees of the type
charged by Macon are limited by § 32-4-92(a)(10) or
other Georgia statutes or regulations. While we have
summarized the respective positions of the parties, we
do not suggest how the state law(s) should be
interpreted or applied. "Where there is any doubt as to
the application of state law, a federal court should certify
the question to the state supreme court to avoid making
unnecessary Erie [R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58
S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)] `guesses' and to offer
the state court the opportunity to interpret or change
existing law." Mosher v. Speedstar Div. of AMCA
Intern., Inc., 52 F.3d 913, 916-17 (11th Cir.1995)

We have a doubt as to the correct answer to the
following question of Georgia law:
WHETHER SECTION 18-153 OF ARTICLE VII OF CHAPTER
18 OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF

CERTIFICATION
We certify the above-styled question to the Supreme
Court of Georgia. The phrasing used in this certified
question should not restrict that Court's consideration
of the problems of state law posed by this case. This
extends to any restatement of the issues by that Court
and the manner in which the answer is given. To assist
that Court's consideration of the case, the entire record,
along with the briefs of the parties, shall be transmitted
