I agree that jurisdiction is lacking. I write separately to
underscore my disagreement with Boschetto's argument
that Hansing, as a seller on eBay, necessarily availed
himself of the privilege of doing business in each state
across the nation. I believe that a defendant does not
establish minimum contacts nationwide by listing an
item for sale on eBay; rather, he must do "something
more," such as individually targeting residents of a
particular state, to be haled into another jurisdiction.
The basic principles are well settled. Personal
jurisdiction is proper if it is consistent with the forum
state's long-arm [539 F.3d 1021] statutes and if it
comports with due process of law. Fireman's Fund Ins.
Co. v. Nat'l Bank of Coops., 103 F.3d 888, 893 (9th
Cir.1996). California's long-arm statute extends the
exercise of personal jurisdiction to the limits of due
process. Harris Rutsky & Co. Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Bell &
Clements Ltd., 328 F.3d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir.2003)
(citing Cal.Code Civ. Pro. ยง 410.10). For due process to
be satisfied, a defendant must have "minimum contacts"
with the forum state such that the assertion of
jurisdiction "does not offend traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice." Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy,
453 F.3d 1151, 1155 (9th Cir.2006) (citing Int'l Shoe Co.
v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 315, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed.
95 (1945)).
This circuit applies a three-part test to determine
whether a plaintiff has demonstrated sufficient
minimum contacts to establish specific jurisdiction over
a defendant. Minimum contacts are found where:
(1) the defendant has performed some act or consummated some
transaction within the forum or otherwise purposefully availed
himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum, (2)
the claim arises out of or results from the defendant's forum related
activities, and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.
Id. at 1155 (citing Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta
Nat'l Inc., 223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir.2000)). The
plaintiff bears the burden of satisfying the first two
prongs of the test, and the defendant bears the burden
on the third. Id. Boschetto falls short on the first prong.
The "purposeful availment" requirement ensures that a
defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a
result of "random," "fortuitous," or "attenuated"
contacts. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462,
475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (citations
omitted). We have refined this to mean that the
defendant must either have "purposefully availed"
himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the
forum, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its
laws, or have "purposefully directed" his activities
toward the forum. Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin
Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 807 (9th Cir.2004).
A defendant "purposefully avails" himself of a forum
when he acts in a way that creates a "substantial
connection" with the state, Burger King, 471 U.S. at
475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, see also Kulko v. California
Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84, 94, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56
L.Ed.2d 132 (1978), as where he deliberately engages in
significant activities there, Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,
Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790
(1984), or creates "continuing obligations" between
himself and its residents. Travelers Health Ass'n v.
Virginia, 339 U.S. 643, 648, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154
(1950). In return for taking advantage of the forum
state's "benefits and protections," the defendant must
submit to the burden of being sued there. Burger King,
471 U.S. at 475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174.
A defendant "purposefully directs" activity at a forum
state when he: (1) commits an intentional act, that is (2)
expressly aimed at the forum state, and that (3) causes
harm that he knows is likely to be suffered in that
jurisdiction. See Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 803 (citing
Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d
804 (1984)). Under this "effects test," it is not sufficient
that the defendant took action with a foreseeable effect
in the forum state. Id. at 804-05. He must do "something
more" for courts to conclude that he "expressly aimed"
activity at the forum, such as individually targeting its
residents. Id. at 805; Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1157.
In my view, Hansing did not purposefully avail himself
of California. Hansing [539 F.3d 1022] created no
continuing obligations to California residents by selling
his car on eBay. His only obligation was to complete the
sale with the highest bidder, whoever and wherever he
might be, which Hansing fulfilled by allowing Boschetto
to retrieve the car in Janesville, Wisconsin. Nor did
Hansing's eBay auction establish a substantial
connection between himself and California such that he
invoked the benefits and protections of its laws. There is
no suggestion that he is engaged in ongoing business
activities there,1 and though a Californian ultimately
made the highest of fifty bids, this was a fortuity;
Boschetto does not argue either that Hansing had any
control over the high bidder's location within the
United States, or that the high bidder's residence had
any effect on Hansing's obligations, given Hansing's
requirement that the high bidder either pick up the car
in Wisconsin or, as Boschetto did, arrange for a thirdparty
to ship it somewhere else. World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297-99,
100 S.Ct. 580, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980) ("the foreseeability
that is critical to [the] due process analysis is not the
mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the
forum State. Rather, it is that the defendant's conduct
and connection with the forum State are such that he
should reasonably anticipate being haled into court
there.") (citations omitted).
I also do not think that Hansing purposefully directed
any activity at California. Boschetto argues that Hansing
directed his eBay auction at the state by failing to bar
Californians from bidding. By accepting bids from all
states, he contends, Hansing offered to sell the subject
vehicle to residents of each state of the union, including
California. I disagree that allowing eBay users
throughout the United States and Canada to bid on an
auction subjects the seller to nationwide jurisdiction. As
we have previously held, merely advertising over the
Internet is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction
throughout the United States, even though the
advertisement or website at issue may be viewed
nationwide. Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1157-58;
Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d at 419-20.2 The defendant must
do "something more" to aim activity expressly at a state,
Cybersell, 130 F.3d at 418, 419; Pebble Beach Co., 453
F.3d at 1156-57,3 and [539 F.3d 1023] Boschetto has not
shown either that Hansing tailored his auction to the
residents of any state in particular, or that he sent or
advertised his auction to any state in particular, much
less California.4 Arguably, Hansing could foresee that
California residents would bid on his auction, and that
he would benefit from their participation, but
foreseeable participation by Californians is not enough.
Hansing must have done something more to aim his
auction expressly at the state, such as individually
targeting California residents.5 Pebble Beach Co., 453
F.3d at 1157. On the facts of this case, he did nothing
more. He simply permitted those with eBay access
throughout the United States and Canada to bid on his
car, agreeing to let the winner retrieve it in Janesville,
Wisconsin.
Accordingly, although Hansing listed his car for sale in
an unrestricted eBay auction, allowing residents of all
states to view the auction and bid, and though he
ultimately sold the car to a California resident, he
neither availed himself of the privilege of doing business
in California nor purposefully directed any activity at
the state.6
I agree that the district court did not abuse its discretion
by denying Boschetto jurisdictional discovery. Where,
as here, a plaintiff's claim of personal jurisdiction is both
attenuated and based on bare allegations rebutted by
specific denials made by the defendants, the district
court need not permit even limited discovery.
