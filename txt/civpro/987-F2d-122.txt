Plaintiffs-appellants Sebastian and Maria Shaumyan
("the Shaumyans") brought this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action
as a class action on behalf of themselves and others
against defendant-appellee Sidetex Company, Inc.
("Sidetex") and its attorney, defendant-appellee Steven
Rolnick.1 In their complaint, [987 F.2d 123] the
Shaumyans alleged that the defendants deprived them of
their property rights without due process by attaching
their home pursuant to Connecticut's prejudgment
attachment statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. § 52-278e(a)(1)
(1991). Section 52-278e(a)(1) permits a plaintiff to
attach a defendant's real property in the absence of a
predeprivation hearing and without requiring that the
plaintiff post a security bond. The district court granted
the defendants' motion for summary judgment and
dismissed the Shaumyans' complaint. See Shaumyan v.
O'Neill, 716 F.Supp. 65 (D.Conn.1989) ("Shaumyan I").
In a subsequent opinion, the district court reconsidered
its prior decision in light of the Supreme Court's
decision in Connecticut v. Doehr, ___ U.S. ___, 111
S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), and reaffirmed its
earlier holding that Connecticut's statute was
constitutional as applied to the case before it. See
Shaumyan v. O'Neill, 795 F.Supp. 528 (D.Conn.1992)
("Shaumyan II"). For the reasons set forth below, we
affirm the district court's finding that section 52-
278e(a)(1) is constitutional as applied to this debtorcreditor
dispute.
BACKGROUND
Sebastian Shaumyan, a professor of linguistics at Yale
University, and his wife, Maria Shaumyan, contracted
with Sidetex on November 10, 1986 for repairs to be
made to their home in New Haven, Connecticut. The
repairs included painting as well as the installation of
siding, storm windows, doors and shutters. The total
contract price was $14,800.00. The contract specified
that the Shaumyans were to pay a $3000 deposit, $4000
at the commencement of work, $3900 when the work
was half completed, $1950 upon the completion of the
siding, and $1950 upon the completion of the storm
windows and shutters. After Sidetex had completed its
performance, a dispute arose over the quality of the
storm windows. In an attempt to satisfy the Shaumyans,
Sidetex installed new storm windows and charged the
Shaumyans an additional $1800, representing only the
cost of materials and labor. This additional work was
described in a change order executed by Professor
Shaumyan and a representative of Sidetex. After Sidetex
installed the new windows, the Shaumyans refused to
pay an outstanding balance of $3900 due on the original
contract and the $1800 balance due on the change order.
Sidetex retained Steven Rolnick, who applied for an ex
parte prejudgment attachment writ against the
Shaumyans' home, pursuant to section 52-278e(a)(1), by
submitting an affidavit of probable cause and a copy of
Sidetex's complaint to a Connecticut Superior Court
judge on July 28, 1987. The affidavit of probable cause
was signed by Paul Knapp, the President of Sidetex, and
stated that: the Shaumyans had signed a contract with
Sidetex to install storm windows in their home; the
contract price was $14,800.00; Sidetex performed its
obligations under the contract; the Shaumyans refused
to pay the $5700 balance due despite repeated demands
by Sidetex; there were no set-offs, defenses or
counterclaims against the outstanding debt; and there
was "probable cause to sustain the validity of the
plaintiff's claim." The superior court judge granted
Sidetex's application on July 30, ordering an attachment
in favor of Sidetex in the amount of $6300. Sidetex then
filed a breach of contract action in Connecticut Superior
Court against the Shaumyans. See Sidetex Co. v.
Shaumyan, No. CV 87-0261076 (Conn.Super.Ct. June
21, 1989).
While Sidetex's state court action was pending, the
Shaumyans filed this action in the district court on
October 19, 1987 against Sidetex and Rolnick seeking: a
declaratory judgment that section 52-278e(a)(1) was
unconstitutional; an injunction prohibiting Sidetex from
attaching their real property; and compensatory and
punitive damages together with costs and attorneys'
fees. In response to the Shaumyans' suit, Sidetex released
the July 30 ex parte attachment on November 6 and
began [987 F.2d 124] proceedings to obtain an
attachment after a plenary hearing. After holding a
hearing on December 14, 1987, a Connecticut Superior
Court judge granted Sidetex's motion to attach the
Shaumyans' home in the amount of $6500. This
attachment was recorded on January 12, 1988. On June
21, 1989, the Connecticut Superior Court entered final
judgment in favor of Sidetex on its breach of contract
claim for $5700 — six hundred dollars less than the
amount of its original attachment against the
Shaumyans' home. Six days later, the district court
granted Sidetex's motion for summary judgment and
dismissed the Shaumyans' complaint.
On appeal, we remanded the case to the district court
for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's
opinion in Connecticut v. Doehr, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct.
2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), affirming our decision in
Pinsky v. Duncan, 898 F.2d 852 (2d Cir.1990), that
Connecticut's prejudgment attachment statute was
unconstitutional as applied to intentional tortfeasors.
On remand, the district court affirmed its earlier
decision upholding the constitutionality of the
Connecticut statute as it was applied to the Shaumyans.
The Shaumyans appeal from the judgment of the district
court.
DISCUSSION
I.
Section 52-278e(a)(1) authorizes the prejudgment
attachment of real property without affording prior
notice or the opportunity for a prior hearing to the
individual whose property is the subject of attachment.
Conn.Gen.Stat. § 52-278e(a)(1) (1991). The statute also
does not require a plaintiff to post a security bond to
insure the payment of damages that a defendant may
suffer if the attachment is later found to be wrongly
issued or the claim proves to be unsuccessful. The
statute does require the plaintiff to submit an affidavit of
probable cause to a judge, who must then determine
whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood that
he will succeed on the merits before granting the writ of
attachment. Id. The statute also provides for notice to be
given to the defendant after the attachment, informing
him that he has the right to a postdeprivation hearing:
to claim that no probable cause existed to sustain the
claim; to request that the attachment be vacated,
modified or that a bond be substituted; or to claim that
some portion of the attached property was exempt from
the execution. Id. § 52-278e(b). In the event that a
defendant chooses to exercise his right to a
postdeprivation hearing, the court must hold such a
hearing within seven business days after the defendant
requests one. Id. § 52-278e(c). On appeal, the
Shaumyans argue that section 52-278e(a)(1) is
unconstitutional because it fails to provide for a
predeprivation hearing and because it fails to provide
for the posting of a bond. Before addressing these
arguments, we first summarize the Supreme Court cases
addressing the constitutionality of prejudgment
attachment statutes.
In Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395
U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969), the
Supreme Court held that a Wisconsin statute permitting
the prejudgment garnishment of a debtor's wages
without prior notice or a hearing violated the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
Court took care to note that the statute allowed a court
clerk rather than a judge to garnish a defendant's wages
at the request of the creditor's attorney, id. at 338, 89
S.Ct. at 1821, and noted further that wages were "a
specialized type of property presenting distinct problems
in our economic system," id. at 340, 89 S.Ct. at 1822.
Three years after Sniadach was decided, the Court in
Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d
556 (1972), invalidated Florida and Pennsylvania
replevin statutes on due process grounds. The Florida
statute allowed a creditor to seize the personal property
of a debtor without a showing of probable cause,
without judicial supervision, and without prior notice or
a hearing. Id. at 73-74, 93, 92 S.Ct. at 1991, 2000. The
Pennsylvania statute not only lacked the same
procedural safeguards as the Florida statute but also
failed to provide for a postdeprivation hearing. [987
F.2d 125] Id. at 75, 92 S.Ct. at 1991. Both statutes
required the plaintiff-creditor to post a security bond
equal to double the amount of the seized property.
Notwithstanding the security bond provisions in the
statutes, the Court found the procedural safeguards to be
inadequate and thus extended the due process
protections it established in Sniadach to include a
debtor's possessory interest in the use and enjoyment of
his personal property, id. at 84, 92 S.Ct. at 1996.
In Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct.
1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974), the Court declined to strike
down on due process grounds a Louisiana statute that
permitted a creditor-lienholder to seek the sequestration
of disputed goods in an ex parte proceeding. In its
decision, the Court noted that the statute: required a
creditor to present a fact-specific affidavit to a judge;
required a creditor to post a security bond; required the
judge to hold a postdeprivation hearing immediately;
and allowed the debtor to regain interim possession of
the property by filing a substitute bond. Id. at 605-07, 94
S.Ct. at 1899-1900.
In the same year that it decided Mitchell, the Court
affirmed without opinion Spielman-Fond, Inc. v.
Hanson's, Inc., 379 F.Supp. 997 (D.Ariz.1973) (per
curiam), aff'd mem., 417 U.S. 901, 94 S.Ct. 2596, 41
L.Ed.2d 208 (1974). In Spielman-Fond, a three-judge
court declined to strike down Arizona's mechanic's lien
statute on due process grounds even though the statute
did not have the procedural safeguards that were present
in Mitchell. The district court upheld the statute because
it did not consider the encumbrance placed on the real
property by the mechanic's lien to be a "taking of a
significant property interest." 379 F.Supp. at 999.
In North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. DiChem, Inc., 419
U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975), the Court
struck down Georgia's prejudgment garnishment
statute, which allowed a creditor to obtain an ex parte
writ garnishing a debtor's bank account after submitting
an affidavit containing only conclusory allegations to a
court clerk. Like the statutes in Fuentes, the Georgia
statute also required a creditor to post a bond equal to
double the amount of the debt due, and it allowed a
debtor to regain possession of the property by filing a
substitute bond. The Court held that, like the statutes in
Fuentes, the Georgia statute violated the Due Process
Clause because it lacked any requirement for an affidavit
of probable cause, or judicial oversight and included no
provision for a hearing.
Finally, in Doehr, supra, the Court struck down the
statute implicated here as applied to defendants in
intentional tort cases. The Doehr Court applied the
three-prong test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18
(1976), to determine whether Connecticut's
prejudgment attachment statute violated the Due
Process Clause. First, the court must consider the
private interests that will be affected by the prejudgment
measure. Second, the court must examine the risk of
erroneous deprivation through the procedures under
attack and the probable value of additional or alternative
safeguards. And third, the court must consider the
interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy.
Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2112. With respect
to the first prong, the Doehr Court ruled that an
attachment affects a significant interest in real property
even though the attachment of that interest did not
amount to a complete, permanent deprivation of the
property. Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2113. With respect to
the second prong, the Doehr Court struck down the
application of section 52-278e(a)(1) to tortfeasors
because it found the risk of an erroneous deprivation to
be substantial. Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2114. The low
standard of proof required in the affidavit of probable
cause combined with the inability of a court to predict
with precision the outcome of an intentional tort case
with all of its complex variables outweighed the
procedural safeguards provided by the postdeprivation
hearing. Id. In applying the third prong of its test, the
Doehr Court found that the plaintiff had no existing
interest in the defendant's real property [987 F.2d 126]
when he sought the attachment. His only interest in
attaching the property was to ensure the availability of
assets to satisfy his judgment if he prevailed on the
merits of his tort action. Id. at ____, 111 S.Ct. at 2115.
Five members of the Doehr Court declined to address
the issue of whether the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1)
to require that a plaintiff post a security bond violated
the Due Process Clause. A plurality of four Justices,
however, reached this issue and stated that due process
required a plaintiff to post a security bond to obtain a
prejudgment attachment. The plurality reasoned that a
bond was especially necessary in tort cases because it
provided an extra measure of protection against the
danger of wrongful attachment in such unpredictable
cases. Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2117. Having reviewed the
Supreme Court's decisions discussing due process and
prejudgment attachments, we now proceed to address
the substance of the Shaumyans' arguments.
II.
A.
The Shaumyans first argue that section 52-278e(a)(1) is
unconstitutional on its face because it fails to provide for
a predeprivation hearing, as the Doehr Court required
in intentional tort cases. In determining whether a
statute violates the Due Process Clause, we begin with
the "truism that `[d]ue process unlike some legal rules, is
not a technical conception with a fixed content
unrelated to time, place and circumstances.'" Doehr, at
___, 111 S.Ct. at 2112 (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at
334, 96 S.Ct. at 902). We therefore decline to accept the
Shaumyans' invitation to determine whether section 52-
278e(a)(1) is prima facie unconstitutional. Rather, as in
Doehr, we will determine whether the statute is
unconstitutional as applied to the Shaumyans. See
Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2109 ("We hold
that, as applied to this case, [section 52-278e(a)(1)] does
not [satisfy the Due Process Clause].") (emphasis added).
(1)
In considering the private interests that will be affected
by section 52-278e(a)(1), we find that the same property
interests that were threatened by the application of
section 52-278e(a)(1) to intentional tortfeasors in Doehr
are present here. Like the property owner in Doehr, an
attachment of the Shaumyans' home would cloud its
title, impair their ability to sell or otherwise alienate
their property, taint their credit rating, reduce their
chances of obtaining a home equity loan or an additional
mortgage, and possibly cause any existing mortgage to
be cast into default. See id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2113.
Thus, applying the first prong set forth in Doehr
supports the Shaumyans' position.
(2)
In applying the second prong of the Doehr test, we do
not find that the application of section 52-278e(a)(1) to
the Shaumyans would create a substantial risk of
erroneous deprivation. See id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2113.
In determining that the submission of an affidavit of
probable cause to a judge did not satisfy the Due Process
Clause, the Doehr Court noted that this procedure did
not protect the defendant against the uncertainties that
are associated with intentional tort cases: "Unlike
determining the existence of a debt or delinquent
payments, the issue does not concern `ordinarily
uncomplicated matters that lend themselves to
documentary proof.'" Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2114
(emphasis added) (quoting Mitchell, 416 U.S. at 609, 94
S.Ct. at 1901). Later in the opinion, the Court
emphasized that "disputes between debtors and creditors
more readily lend themselves to accurate ex parte
assessments of the merits." Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111
S.Ct. at 2115; see also Union Trust Co. v. Heggelund,
219 Conn. 620, 594 A.2d 464, 466 n. 3 (1991).
The facts present in the Shaumyans' case fall into the
category of cases that the Doehr Court sought to
distinguish from intentional tort cases. Sidetex installed
storm windows in the Shaumyans' home. The
Shaumyans refused to pay an outstanding [987 F.2d 127]
sum certain due under their contract with Sidetex.
Sidetex sued the Shaumyans for that sum certain and
subsequently received a judgment for six hundred
dollars less than the amount of the initial prejudgment
attachment. The facts of the underlying claim were
easily documented, and, in the absence of a substantial
risk of erroneous deprivation, we find that the
procedural safeguards of section 52-278e(a)(1) are
similar to those in the statute that was upheld in
Mitchell and therefore satisfy the second prong of the
Doehr test.
(3)
The third prong of the Doehr test examines the interests
of the plaintiff. In Doehr, the Court found that the
plaintiff "had no existing interest in [the tortfeasor's]
real estate when he sought the attachment. His only
interest in attaching the property was to ensure the
availability of assets to satisfy his judgment if he
prevailed on the merits of his action." Doehr, ___ U.S. at
___, 111 S.Ct. at 2115. Unlike the plaintiff in Doehr,
Sidetex had a substantial pre-existing interest in the
Shaumyans' real property. Sidetex furnished labor and
materials for the improvement of the Shaumyans' home.
Since neither Sidetex's labor nor its materials could be
reclaimed once they became part of the Shaumyans'
home, the prejudgment attachment statute provided
Sidetex with a remedy to protect its interest in the
Shaumyans' property. Cf. id. at ____, 111 S.Ct. at 2122
(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) (discussing importance of
mechanic's lien statutes). Therefore, even though
Sidetex failed to file and perfect a mechanic's lien,
Sidetex's unperfected lien nonetheless constituted an
interest in the Shaumyans' real property.
In their briefs and during oral argument, both parties
admitted that Sidetex could have obtained a mechanic's
lien against the Shaumyans' house under Connecticut's
mechanic's lien statute. We have examined that statute
and the Connecticut case law interpreting it and agree
with both parties that it could have been invoked in this
case.2 Moreover, the Arizona mechanic's lien statute
that was challenged in Spielman-Fond, supra, was very
similar to the Connecticut mechanic's lien statute.
Indeed, the Doehr Court suggested that Spielman-Fond
could have been affirmed on the ground that the
Arizona statute protected a creditor's pre-existing
interest in property that is the subject of a mechanic's
lien. See Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___ n. 4, 111 S.Ct. at 2113 n.
4. Thus, because the procedural safeguards of section
52-278e(a)(1) satisfy the second [987 F.2d 128] and third
prongs of the Doehr test as it is applied to the
Shaumyans, we hold that it does not violate the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B.
The Shaumyans also argue that section 52-278e(a)(1) is
unconstitutional because it does not require a plaintiff to
post a security bond. A similar argument was made by
the defendants in Pinsky v. Duncan, 898 F.2d 852 (2d
Cir.1990), aff'd sub nom., Connecticut v. Doehr, ___
U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), and was
rejected by two members of the panel. See Pinsky, 898
F.2d at 858-61 (Mahoney, J., concurring); id. at 864
(Newman, J., dissenting). Because only a plurality of
four Justices in Doehr addressed this issue, principles of
stare decisis would normally preclude us from
considering this issue anew. See Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v.
Sara Lee Corp., 900 F.2d 522, 527 (2d Cir.) ("`a panel of
this court will not overturn a recent decision of another
panel, rendered after full consideration of the very point
at issue'") (quoting Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp.,
623 F.2d 786, 788 (2d Cir. 1980), aff'd, 456 U.S. 461, 102
S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982)), cert. denied, 498 U.S.
846, 111 S.Ct. 132, 112 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). However,
because the Connecticut Supreme Court has revisited its
state's vexatious litigation statute since we decided
Pinsky, we will reexamine this issue in light of this new
decision, although our analysis ultimately leads us to the
same conclusion.
In Pinsky, the concurring and dissenting judges agreed
that the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1) to require the
plaintiff to post a security bond was not constitutionally
defective because a defendant whose property had been
wrongfully attached could bring a counterclaim for
damages under Connecticut's vexatious litigation
statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. § 52-568(a) (1991), instead of
having to initiate a new action. See Pinsky, 898 F.2d at
860-61 (Mahoney, J., concurring); id. at 862 (Newman,
J., dissenting). The concurring and dissenting opinions
did not discuss the standard for determining liability
under the vexatious litigation statute, however. The
Connecticut vexatious litigation statute provides:
Any person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or
complaint against another ... (1) without probable cause, shall pay
such other person double damages, or (2) without probable cause,
and with a malicious intent unjustly to vex and trouble such other
person, shall pay him treble damages.
Conn.Gen.Stat. § 52-568(a). After Pinsky was decided,
the Connecticut Supreme Court decided DeLaurentis v.
City of New Haven, 220 Conn. 225, 597 A.2d 807
(1991). The DeLaurentis court defined probable cause to
mean a "good faith belief in the facts alleged and the
validity of the claim asserted." Id. 597 A.2d at 823. The
court defined malice to mean "`a purpose other than
that of securing the proper adjudication of the claim. . .
.'" Id. at 822 n. 16 (quoting Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 676 (1977)). Thus, although the standard of
liability articulated by the DeLaurentis court apparently
would limit the number of debtors who could bring
vexatious litigation suits against creditors who attached
their real property pursuant to section 52-278e(a)(1),
plaintiffs like the Shaumyans may still utilize
Connecticut's vexatious litigation statute to protect their
interests in the absence of a security bond.
In holding that a security bond need not be posted in
connection with a prejudgment attachment, we rely on
the language of the Doehr plurality, the conclusion
reached by the concurring and dissenting opinions in
Pinsky and the absence of a bond requirement in the
mechanic's lien statutes of Connecticut and other states.
In Doehr, the plurality found the statute to be defective
for the additional reason that it failed to require the
posting of a security bond in intentional tort cases. The
plurality noted that a security bond requirement would
not alleviate the need for a predeprivation hearing. Like
the predeprivation hearing, the bond requirement
insured against the "unacceptably high" risk that the
tortfeasor's "property rights may be wrongfully deprived
... even with such safeguards as a hearing or exigency
requirement." [987 F.2d 129] Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111
S.Ct. at 2117; see also North Ga. Finishing, 419 U.S. 601,
95 S.Ct. 719 (statute containing bond provision struck
down); Fuentes, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983 (same).
Thus, like the predeprivation hearing, the Doehr
plurality justified its requirement for the posting of a
security bond on the substantial risk of wrongful
deprivation. As we have discussed above, ante at pp.
126-27, no such risk exists in this case, and therefore,
due process does not require Sidetex to post a security
bond.
We also find support in Chief Justice Rehnquist's
observation in Doehr that due process would not
mandate that a mechanic's lien statute like the one in
Spielman-Fond require the posting of a security bond.
See Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2122
(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) ("To require any sort of a
contested court hearing or bond before the notice of [a
mechanic's] lien takes effect would largely defeat the
purpose of these statutes."). Because Sidetex used section
52-278e(a)(1) to achieve the same results that it could
have achieved under Connecticut's mechanic's lien
statute, see ante at pp. 127-28 n. 2, we see no reason
why due process would require it to post a bond in one
instance but not in the other. Therefore, we hold that
the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1) to require Sidetex to
post a security bond does not violate the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
CONCLUSION
In upholding the constitutionality of section 52-
278e(a)(1) against the challenges brought by the
Shaumyans, Judge Nevas wrote in his second opinion
that his decision was "limited exclusively to the facts of
this case and its application to a breach of contract
action involving an attachment of real property in
which the attaching plaintiff seeks payment for material
installed and labor performed on that piece of real
property." Shaumyan II, 795 F.Supp. at 534. We agree,
and affirm the judgment of the district court in all
respects.
