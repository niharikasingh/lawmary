The importance of formulating a proper standard in
federal court to test the sufficiency of the evidence for
submission of a case to the jury, in connection with
motions for a directed verdict and for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict, caused us to place this
Alabama diversity personal injury suit en banc.
Shipman, an employee of Boeing, sued his employer for
damages under the common law and the Alabama
Employers' Liability Act (Tit. 26, § 326, Code of Ala.,
1940), as a result of injuries he claims were received in
the course of his work at Boeing's Huntsville, Alabama,
plant. He was a spray painter and alleged that his
employer was negligent in failing to furnish him with a
reasonably safe place to work which was not properly
ventilated to exhaust paint fumes; also, that he was not
furnished with a mask to prevent inhalation of paint,
nor with protective [411 F.2d 368] gloves for the
handling of harmful chemicals, and that he was not
warned of the dangers of his employment. He contended
that he contracted lead poisoning, polyneuritis,
dermatitis, and an aggravation of pre-existing
bronchitis. Boeing denied any misconduct which might
have caused Shipman's injuries and pled contributory
negligence and assumption of risk and that the Alabama
Workmen's Compensation Act barred an action for
damages.
In the prior opinion in this case the Court said:
"On the question of Boeing's alleged misconduct, the evidence is
weak, especially in view of the short time that Shipman worked for
Boeing. The evidence as to causal connection between the claimed
unsafe conditions of Shipman's place of work and the ailments
which he suffered can be held sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict
only by the application of an extremely liberal standard." (389 F.2d
at 511.)
Boeing's motions for a directed verdict during the trial
and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict thereafter
were denied by the District Judge, and the decision of a
panel of this Court affirmed the lower Court. We hold
that the opinion of a panel of this Court in the present
case (389 F.2d 507) contained errors of law, which we
overrule. Nevertheless, we affirm because the evidence
was sufficient to create a question for the jury under the
standard we have established, and the District Court,
therefore, properly denied the motions for a directed
verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
We will not restate in detail the critical issues of fact on
which Shipman based his case, since they are adequately
treated in the original opinion herein, except to say that
Shipman had been working for three months as a spray
painter for Boeing and testified that the room in which
he was working was not properly equipped with an
exhaust system, that he was not provided with a
respirator mask, that he inhaled paint particles as a
result thereof, and that he also incurred injuries to his
hands because of the failure to furnish him with gloves.
The medical evidence was not conclusive, and the facts
relating to the cause of Shipman's ailments were
seriously disputed by Boeing. However, there was
sufficient evidence of failure to provide a reasonably safe
place to work and a face mask and gloves to require
submission of the case to the jury under the standard we
hereafter promulgate in this opinion.
I.
FEDERAL RATHER THAN STATE TEST IS
APPLICABLE
It is well settled in this Circuit that in diversity cases
federal courts apply a federal rather than a state test for
the sufficiency of evidence to create a jury question.
Reuter v. Eastern Air Lines, 5 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d
443;[411 F.2d 369] Revlon, Inc. v. Buchanan, 5 Cir.,
1959, 271 F.2d 795, 81 A.L.R.2d 222; Planters
Manufacturing Co. v. Protection Mut. Ins. Co., 5 Cir.,
1967, 380 F.2d 869; Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v.
Pruitt, 5 Cir., 1967, 385 F.2d 841.
In Planters, supra, Judge Tuttle exhaustively discussed
this issue and pointed out (380 F.2d at 870-871) that
although the Supreme Court had not yet resolved the
question in favor of the federal test, that Court had said
in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, 356
U.S. 525, 538, 78 S.Ct. 893, 901, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958):
"It cannot be gainsaid that there is a strong federal policy against
allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship in the
federal courts."
See also Herron v. Southern Pac. Co., 283 U.S. 91, 51
S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed. 857 (1931); Simler v. Conner, 372
U.S. 221, 83 S.Ct. 609, 9 L.Ed.2d 691 (1963).
Federal courts must be able to control the fact-finding
processes by [411 F.2d 370] which the rights of litigants
are determined in order to preserve "the essential
character" of the federal judicial system. Of course, we
do not contend that this control will not affect statecreated
substantive rights in some cases. Ultimately,
however, the integrity of our fact-finding processes
must outweigh considerations of uniformity. Herron v.
Southern Pac. Co., 283 U.S. 91, 51 S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed.
857 (1931); Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric
Cooperative, 356 U.S. 525, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953
(1958); Note, State Trial Procedure and the Federal
Courts: Evidence, Juries, and Directed Verdicts Under
the Erie Doctrine, 66 Harv.L.Rev. 1516, 1525 (1953).
Thus, we agree with the original opinion and reaffirm
our holding, often repeated, that a federal rather than a
state test is the proper one.
II.
FELA (FEDERAL EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY ACT)
STANDARD FOR SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE IS
INAPPLICABLE
In the original opinion in this case the Court held that
the standard to be applied by federal courts in diversity
cases, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence
to submit the case to the jury on motions for a directed
verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, is
the same as that in FELA (45 U.S.C. § 51 et seq.) and
Jones Act (46 U.S.C. § 688) cases and that the "question
has now been settled in this Circuit by the holding in
Planters Manufacturing Co. v. Protection Mut. Ins. Co.,
5 Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 869, * * * that federal courts must
apply the same standards employed in FELA cases to
diversity cases in determining sufficiency of evidence to
raise a question of fact for the jury. * * *" (389 F.2d at
513.) Thus, in the present case the District Judge was
obliged under the Planters principle to apply the same
standard employed in FELA cases to the alleged
negligent acts of Boeing and the extent and nature of
Shipman's injuries in determining the sufficiency of
evidence to create questions for the jury. The Planters
principle, with which we disagree, is expressed as
follows: "It is only when there is a complete absence of
probative facts to support the conclusion reached that
the jury's judgment may be ignored." (380 F.2d at 874.)
The Court based this statement upon language in the
Supreme Court's decision in Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S.
645, 66 S.Ct. 740, 590 L.Ed. 916 (1946), anFELAcase, in
which that Court stated, "Only when there is a complete
absence of probative facts to support the conclusion
reached does a reversible error appear. * * *" (327 U.S. at
653, 66 S.Ct. at 744.)
FELA cases, however, are statutory negligence actions.
The Act provides (45 U.S.C. § 51) that the employer
shall be liable for damages "* * * for such injury or death
resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any
of the officers, agents, or employees * * *." of the carrier.
The Supreme Court held in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific
Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 500, 508, 77 S.Ct. 443, 449, 1
L.Ed.2d 493 (1957), that in FELA cases there is
presented "* * * the single question whether negligence
of the employer played any part, however small, in the
injury or death which is the subject of the suit. The
burden of the employee is met, and the obligation of the
employer to pay damages arises, when there is proof,
even though entirely circumstantial, from which the
jury may with reason make that inference." In Rogers
the Supreme Court also said [411 F.2d 371] (352 U.S. at
506-507, 77 S.Ct. at 448-449):
"Judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury
question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry
whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence
of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death. Judges
are to fix their sights primarily to make that appraisal and, if that
test is met, are bound to find that a case for the jury is made out
whether or not the evidence allows the jury a choice of other
probabilities."
See also Note, Rule 50(b): Judgment Notwithstanding
the Verdict, 58 Colum. L.Rev. 517 (1958).
The Supreme Court further said in Rogers (352 U.S. at
506, 77 S.Ct. at 448):
"Under this statute [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether
the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer
negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the
injury or death for which damages are sought." (Emphasis
supplied.)
Slight negligence, necessary to support an FELA action,
is defined as "a failure to exercise great care," and that
burden of proof, obviously, is much less than the burden
required to sustain recovery in ordinary negligence
actions. Prosser, Law of Torts § 34, p. 186 (3d ed. 1964).
(Emphasis supplied.)
Beyond the fact that a statutory action under the FELA
significantly differs from a common law negligence
action in terms of the standard of proof, it is clear that
the congressional intent in enacting the FELA was to
secure jury determinations in a larger proportion of
cases than would be true of ordinary common law
actions. In other words, "trial by jury is part of the
remedy" in FELA cases. Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc.
v. Ellerman Lines, 369 U.S. 355, 360, 82 S.Ct. 780, 784, 7
L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). As Mr. Justice Douglas stated in his
concurring opinion in Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.S.
53, 68, 69 S.Ct. 413, 420, 93 L.Ed. 497 (1949),
"The Federal Employers' Liability Act was designed to put on the
railroad industry some of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and lives
which it consumed in its operations. * * *
"That purpose was not given a friendly reception in the courts. In
the first place, a great maze of restrictive interpretations were
engrafted on the Act * * *. In the second place, doubtful questions
of fact were taken from the jury and resolved by the courts in favor
of the employer. * * * And so it was that a goodly portion of the
relief which Congress had provided employees was withheld from
them.
"[Since 1943, however,] * * * The historic role of the jury in
performing that function * * * [of passing on disputed questions of
fact] is being restored in this important class of cases."
See also Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 352
U.S. 500, 508-509, 77 S.Ct. 443, 449-450, 1 L.Ed.2d 493
(1957). See generally Griffith, The Vindication of a
National Public Policy Under the Employers' Liability
Act, 18 Law & Contemp.Prob. 160 (1953). Thus, as the
Eighth Circuit has stated,
"Under the [Federal Employers' Liability] Act, the right of the jury
to pass upon the question of fault and causality must be most
liberally viewed. * * * the jury's power to engage in inferences must
be recognized as being significantly broader than in common law
negligence actions."
[411 F.2d 372] Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad
Co. v. Melcher, 8 Cir., 1964, 333 F.2d 996, 999-1000.
Though we have heretofore adopted in Planters
Manufacturing Co. v. Protection Mut. Ins. Co., 5 Cir.,
1967, 380 F.2d 869, the FELA test of the sufficiency of
evidence to create a jury question as a uniform federal
standard fashioning a rule of general application, we
now reject the Planters principle and hold that the FELA
test is peculiar to that kind of case as a consequence of
the statute itself and is accordingly not applicable in
non-FELA jury trials.
As a corollary to the unique statutory context of FELA
actions, it is apparent that in the general run of cases
federal courts have rejected the legendary "scintilla" test.
Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U.S. 90, 50 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed.
720 (1930). In 5 Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 50.02[1], p.
2324 (2d ed. 1968), we find the following pertinent
commentary:
"The federal courts are generally committed to a rejection of the socalled
`scintilla rule,' by which a court might not direct a verdict so
long as there is any evidence in support of the proposition tendered
by the party against whom the motion is directed. An argument
might well be made that such a rule survives, in fact, if not in name,
in FELA and Jones Act cases.20 [20 See e. g., Harlan, J., dissenting
in Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines (1957) 352 U.S. 521, 563-
564, 77 S.Ct. 457, 480, 1 L.Ed.2d 511, 519.] If so, its application is
limited to those areas and cannot be extended beyond those special
domains."
We agree with Professor Moore's analysis and
conclusion that the FELA test should not be employed
as a vehicle to re-establish the "scintilla" rule which has
[411 F.2d 373] been so firmly rejected by the federal
judiciary.
Although the Supreme Court has not answered the
question of law, no Circuit Court of the United States,
other than the Fifth Circuit, has held that the FELA test
of sufficiency of evidence is applicable in non-FELA
cases. The First Circuit expressly rejected the FELA
standard in Dehydrating Process Co. v. A. O. Smith
Corp., 1 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 653, 656 n. 6, stating that
such cases had to be considered "on their own bottom,"
and the Court further said, "We do not appear to have
considered this question ourselves, but a number of
other circuits have reached this result without even
discussion." [Citing, inter alia, Rhodes v. Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co., 5 Cir. 1949, 172 F.2d 183, cert.
denied, 337 U.S. 930, 69 S.Ct. 1495, 93 L.Ed. 1738.] See
Gibson v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway Company, 7
Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 834 (On Petition for Rehearing);
Cahill v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., 2
Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 637 (Frank J., dissenting).
Finally, the Seventh Amendment of the United States
Constitution providing for trial by jury does not require,
either expressly or impliedly, that the test of sufficiency
of evidence to create a jury question in a non-FELA
federal case be the same as in an FELA case. The
tendency of some federal courts, at times, to use overly
broad language or to cite indiscriminately FELA cases in
non-FELA situations does not obviate this conclusion.
See, e. g., Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &
Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 700-701, 82 S.Ct. 1404,
1411, 8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962); Harris v. Pennsylvania
Railroad Co., 361 U.S. 15, 16, 80 S.Ct. 22, 23, 4 L.Ed.2d
1 (1959) (Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring); Bruce
Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp.,
3 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 2, 22.
The standard provided by the Supreme Court and
Circuit Courts in FELA cases for sufficiency of evidence
to create a jury question is proper under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act, and with this we do not
disagree. But in non-FELA federal cases which are not
based on statute, the formulation of the test of
sufficiency of evidence is substantially different.
III.
THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OR
REASONABLE MAN TEST
We now determine what the proper test should be in
determining whether there is sufficient evidence to
submit a [411 F.2d 374] case to the jury in connection
with motions for directed verdict in a federal court
trial. The standard we announce is the result of a
thorough study of the numerous prior decisions of this
Court which have dealt with the subject. Our task is
compounded by the fact that many legal writers and
commentators have used different formulations in
propounding these standards and the language utilized
by them remains diverse and occasionally troublesome.
See 5 Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 50.02 [1], p. 2330 (2d
ed. 1968); Note, Rule 50(b): Judgment Nowithstanding
the Verdict, 58 Colum.L.Rev. 517, 522 n. 45; Blume,
Origin and Development of the Directed Verdict, 48
Mich.L.Rev. 555 (1950).
On motions for directed verdict and for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict the Court should consider
all of the evidence — not just that evidence which
supports the non-mover's case — but in the light and
with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the
party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences
point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one
party that the Court believes that reasonable men could
not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions
is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial
evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of
such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded
men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach
different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and
the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of
evidence is insufficient to present a question for the
jury. The motions for directed verdict and [411 F.2d 375]
judgment n. o. v. should not be decided by which side
has the better of the case, nor should they be granted
only when there is a complete absence of probative facts
to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in
substantial evidence to create a jury question. However,
it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of
the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting
evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of
witnesses.
[411 F.2d 377] Since the Court is sitting en banc in this
matter, we overrule all prior decisions of this Court
insofar as they conflict with this opinion, special
reference being made to those portions of the original
opinion of the Court in the present case and in Planters
Manufacturing Co. v. Protection Mut. Ins. Co., 5 Cir.,
1967, 380 F.2d 869, which do not conform.
IV.
CONSIDERATION OF THE MERITS
Despite our holding that the original opinion of the
panel in this case is based on erroneous principles of
law, we have concluded that the facts of record
sufficiently meet the test we have now formulated to
require affirmance of the District Court's ruling which
denied the motions for directed verdict and judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and submitted the case to
the jury for its verdict. The jury could fairly conclude
from all of the evidence, though disputed, that Boeing
was negligent in failing to provide Shipman with a
reasonably safe place to work and with a serviceable face
mask and adequate gloves. Also, that Shipman was
obliged to work in an area where the booth exhaust fan
was either off or inadequate to siphon off paint fumes in
the area in which he was working. Though the expert
medical proof is not entirely reliable in determining the
causal connection between Shipman's working
conditions and his ailments, uncontroverted lay
testimony showed that Shipman was not suffering from
polyneuritis or dermatitis prior to working for Boeing.
Although he had suffered from bronchitis previously,
the jury could conclude from the evidence that the
condition was aggravated by Boeing's failure to provide
a face mask and adequate ventilation.
Applying the standards we have set forth in this opinion
and considering all the evidence in the record, we hold
that the District Judge properly denied the motions for
directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the
verdict and committed no error in sending the case to
the jury.
Affirmed.
