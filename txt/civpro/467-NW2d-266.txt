Ruth E. Ritz and several other named plaintiffs appeal
from an adverse determination by the court in a
declaratory judgment action seeking to adjudicate
adverse claims to buried money. Plaintiffs are the
beneficiaries and heirs of Charles and Rosa Nelson,
husband and wife, and Opal Nelson, the only daughter
of Charles and [467 N.W.2d 268] Rosa. Charles and
Rosa, and later Opal, owned a dwelling house and lot in
Selma, Iowa. The Nelson family's ownership of this
property spanned a period extending from 1922 until
Opal's death in 1981.1
The property was abandoned by Opal's personal
representative at the time of the final settlement of her
estate because of substantial unpaid real estate taxes and
other clouds on the title. Van Buren County ultimately
gained title to the property at a tax sale. The defendant,
Selma United Methodist Church (the Church),
purchased the property from Van Buren County in
1987.
When the Church razed the house and garage on the
property, a substantial sum of paper money and coins
was found buried in the ground in tin cans and glass
jars. Several silver half-dollars included in this cash
hoard antedated 1900. Also included among the money
discovered were several twenty-dollar and ten-dollar
gold certificates circa 1928. The face amount of the coins
and currency totaled $24,547.74.
The Church advertised this finding in accordance with
Iowa Code section 644.8 (1989). Thereafter, the
plaintiffs made claim to the cash hoard and filed a
petition for declaratory judgment, seeking a
determination that they were the rightful owners of the
money.
Following trial of this claim, the district court found that
Charles Nelson was the true owner of the money and
had buried it at the location where it was found by the
agents of the Church. The court, relying on Iowa Code
section 633.488 (1989), concluded, however, that any
claims of the plaintiffs to this cash hoard had to be
brought within five years of the order of final settlement
in Opal Nelson's estate. Because more than five years
had transpired between the time of that settlement
order and the finding of the money, the court found
plaintiffs were barred from asserting ownership. From
this premise, the court determined that title to the
money vested in the Church, as finder, pursuant to
section 644.11.
Plaintiffs have appealed. They contend that, as heirs or
beneficiaries of the true owner of the money, they have
a superior claim against the present owners of the real
property where it was found. They further urge that
Opal Nelson's estate can be reopened more than five
years after final settlement in order to administer this
newly discovered property. The Church has crossappealed,
challenging the district court's finding that
plaintiffs had established Charles Nelson to be the true
owner of the money. Other facts which are pertinent to
this appeal are mentioned in our discussion of the legal
issues presented.
I. Alternative Remedy to Section 644.12
Determination.
At the outset of our inquiry, we must settle a question
involving our jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The
Church initiated the statutory notice procedure which
has been established for the finders of lost or misplaced
property under section 644.8. If this statutory procedure
had been carried to a conclusion, culminating in a
summary adjudication of ownership under section
644.12, the decision of the district court would have
been final. Iowa Code § 644.12 ("there shall be no appeal
from the decision"). The latter statute also provides,
however, that it "does not bar any other remedy given
by law." Id. We conclude that a declaratory judgment
action under Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 261 is a
sanctioned alternative to a summary adjudication under
section 644.12. When a declaratory judgment action is
utilized to settle ownership of lost or mislaid property
and that action proceeds to a final judgment, this court
may review such judgment pursuant to Iowa Rule of
Civil Procedure 267.
II. Ownership of Lost or Mislaid Property.
The rights of finders of property vary according to the
characterization of [467 N.W.2d 269] the property
found. In Goddard v. Winchell, 86 Iowa 71, 85-86, 52
N.W. 1124, 1125 (1892), this court set out some of the
legal principles which apply. The general rule is that the
finder of lost property becomes the owner thereof
against the whole world other than the true owner. Id.
at 85, 52 N.W. at 1125. Property is lost when the owner
unintentionally and involuntarily parts with its
possession and does not know where it is. Eldridge v.
Herman, 291 N.W.2d 319, 323 (Iowa 1980).
Mislaid property is that which the owner has voluntarily
placed somewhere and then forgets that it is there. 1
Am. Jur.2d Abandoned, Lost, and Unclaimed Property §
2, at 4 (1962) [hereinafter 1 Am.Jur.2d]. The right of
possession of mislaid property is in the owner of the
premises upon which it is found, as against all persons
other than the true owner. Id.; State ex rel. Scott v.
Buzard, 235 Mo.App. 636, 642, 144 S.W.2d 847, 849
(1940).
Property which has become a part of the natural earth is
not subject to the general rule of lost or mislaid
property. Goddard, 86 Iowa at 85, 52 N.W. at 1125.
Such property belongs to the owner of the real estate
upon which it was found. Id. Examples of this type of
property are a meteorite, a prehistoric boat, valuable
earthenware and gold-bearing quartz. 1 Am.Jur.2d § 4,
at 6; Allred v. Biegel, 240 Mo.App. 818, 820, 219 S.W.2d
665, 666 (1949); Burdick v. Chesebrough, 94 A.D. 532,
537, 88 N.Y.S. 13, 15 (1904).
Treasure trove is treated as lost and belongs to the
finder as against all except the true owner. Zornes v.
Bowen, 223 Iowa 1141, 1145, 274 N.W. 877, 879 (1937).
Treasure trove consists of coins or paper money which
is concealed by the owner; it carries with it the thought
of antiquity such that it has been hidden so long that the
true owner is not discoverable. Hill v. Schrunk, 207 Or.
71, 74, 292 P.2d 141, 143 (1956); 1 Am.Jur.2d § 4, at 6.
Abandoned property is that to which the owner has
voluntarily relinquished all right, title, and interest with
the intention of terminating his ownership. Id. § 1, at 3.
The finder who reduces abandoned property to
possession acquires absolute title as against the former
owner. Id. § 18, at 18.
Although the real estate was abandoned by Opal's estate,
we believe that it would be a completely unwarranted
inference to conclude that the money found by the
Church had been abandoned by its owner. The fact that
it was buried in jars and tin cans indicates that the
owner was attempting to preserve it. Likewise, the
money did not bear the characteristics of property
embedded in the soil. It is fairly to be classified as the
type of property to which the true owner retains
ownership as against the finder or the owner of the
property where it is found.
In applying the rules of ownership relating to lost or
mislaid property, courts are in general agreement that if
the original owner is deceased that person's heirs or
legatees are entitled to lay claim to the property. United
States v. Peter, 178 F.Supp. 854, 856 (E.D.La.1959), aff'd,
283 F.2d 696 (5th Cir.1960); Davison v. Strickland, 145
Ga.App. 420, 423, 243 S.E.2d 705, 709 (1978); Baugh v.
Williams' Adm'r, 264 Ky. 167, 171, 94 S.W.2d 330, 332
(1936); In re Wright's Estate, 15 Misc.2d 225, 230, 177
N.Y.S.2d 410, 418 (1958); see also 1 Am.Jur.2d § 25, at
22.
III. Whether Plaintiffs' Claims are Barred.
The record indicates that Opal Nelson died testate and
unmarried in May of 1981. Her will was admitted to
probate. The distributable portion of her estate was
bequeathed to specific legatees in stated percentages.
The defendant Church was one of these legatees as were
several of the plaintiffs.
Although the district court found that Charles Nelson
had been the owner of the found money and that his
interest therein had passed to Opal, it concluded that
plaintiffs were barred from claiming by, through, or
under Opal. It based this conclusion on the five-year
limitation which section 633.488 places on reopening a
final settlement in an estate.
[467 N.W.2d 270] Plaintiffs urge that the time limit
fixed in section 633.488 does not preclude reopening
Opal's estate to administer newly discovered property.
We believe that both section 633.488 and section
633.489 are involved in resolving this issue. These
statutes provide, in relevant part, as follows:
633.488 Reopening settlement.
Whenever a final report has been approved and a final accounting
has been settled in the absence of any person adversely affected and
without notice to the person, the hearing on such report and
accounting may be reopened at any time within five years from the
entry of the order approving the same, upon the application of such
person, and, upon a hearing, after such notice as the court may
prescribe to be served upon the personal representative and the
distributees, the court may require a new accounting, or a
redistribution from the distributees....
633.489 Reopening administration.
Upon the petition of any interested person, the court may, with
such notice as it may prescribe, order an estate reopened if other
property be discovered, if any necessary act remains unperformed,
or for any other proper cause appearing to the court. It may
reappoint the personal representative, or appoint another personal
representative, to administer any additional property or to perform
other such acts as may be deemed necessary.
As with any issue of statutory interpretation, we begin
with the language of the act and go no further if its
meaning is clear. In re Hoppe, 289 N.W.2d 613, 616
(Iowa 1980); City of Des Moines v. Elliott, 267 N.W.2d
44, 45 (Iowa 1978); Iowa Code § 4.1(2) (1989). The fiveyear
limitation on reopening a final settlement
contained in section 633.488 is, by its express terms,
aimed at an attempt to reopen an estate by an adversely
affected person who was not given notice and
opportunity to be heard on the final report.2
Section 633.488 contemplates a reopening of matters
which have been previously considered in the final
accounting, distribution, and settlement order. Section
633.489, on the other hand, is aimed at reopening a
closed estate for the purpose of administering property
omitted from the inventory or performing other
necessary acts which were not performed during the
original administration. Section 633.489 does not place
any time limitation on reopening for such purposes.
Based on the district court's finding as to Charles
Nelson's ownership and Opal's succession thereto, the
bills and coins were property of Opal which were not
administered in her estate. This is a circumstance which
allows reopening of that estate for purposes of
administering these assets and making distribution to
her legatees in their proportionate share. These legatees
are the rightful owners of the money rather than the
finder.3 This is true even though Opal was not aware of
the buried money at the time of her death. See In re
Weber's Estate, 162 Neb. 636, 642, 77 N.W.2d 158, 162
(1956) (after acquired property passes under will
purporting to dispose of all testator's property even
though testator was unaware of same); 96 C.J.S. Wills §
756, at 155-56 (1957) (same). The district court erred in
concluding otherwise.
IV. Defendant's Cross-Appeal.
As a final matter, we must consider the Church's
attempt to save the judgment on the assertion that the
court erred [467 N.W.2d 271] in finding Charles Nelson
to be the owner of the money. The Church bases this
challenge primarily on the fact that an inventory of
some of the paper money prepared by members of the
Church indicates the issuance date on a few of the bills
was later than the time of Charles' death.
Plaintiffs sought at trial to require production of the
actual money. The court refused to compel its
production and accepted the Church's handwritten
inventory as evidence. Because the Church had the
opportunity to produce the bills which allegedly were
dated after Charles' death and successfully resisted doing
so, it is now open to an adverse inference that the actual
evidence would have been unfavorable. See Crosser v.
Iowa Dep't of Pub. Safety, 240 N.W.2d 682, 685 (Iowa
1976). There was sufficient evidence in the record to
support the district court's finding that all of the money
belonged to Charles.
We further note on this issue that the same
circumstances of frugal living, continuous access to the
location of the money, and an inclination to hoard cash,
which caused the court to find as it did concerning
Charles' ownership, would suggest that, if he had not
placed the money where it was found, then this was
done by Rosa or Opal. Had this been the case, it would
not have altered the basis for plaintiffs' claims in any
significant way.
We have considered all issues presented and conclude
that the judgment of the district court must be reversed.
The case is remanded to that court for entry of a new
declaratory judgment consistent with our opinion.
REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND
REMANDED.
