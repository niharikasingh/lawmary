I agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART that this case is
not properly before us. I write separately to express my
own reasons for reaching that conclusion.
The claimed harm that gave birth to this lawsuit was the
alleged deprivation of liberty attending appellee's
transfer to the Lincoln Regional Center. It is clear to me
that that asserted injury disappeared, at the latest, when
appellee was 
[445 U.S. 502]
 granted parole.
1 
 Cf. Preiser
v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395 (1975). So did any immediate
threat that that injury would be suffered again. Appellee
has been returned to custody, however, and the 
[445
U.S. 503]
 parties agree that his reincarceration, coupled
with his history of mental problems, has brought the
controversy back to life.
Given these facts, the issue is not so much one of
mootness as one of ripeness. At most, although I think
otherwise, it is a case presenting a "mixed question" of
ripeness and mootness, hinging on the possibility that
the challenged procedures will be applied again to
appellee. This Court has confronted mixed questions of
this kind in cases presenting issues "capable of
repetition, yet evading review," see, e. g., Nebraska Press
Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976), and Sosna v. Iowa,
419 U.S. 393 (1975), and in cases concerning the
cessation of challenged conduct during the pendency of
litigation, see, e. g., Walling v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.,
323 U.S. 37, 43 (1944). In those contexts, the Court has
lowered the ripeness threshold so as to preclude
manipulation by the parties or the mere passage of time
from frustrating judicial review. MR. JUSTICE
STEWART correctly observes, and the Court
apparently concedes, however, that the "capable of
repetition" doctrine does not apply here. Neither does
the liberal rule applied in "voluntary cessation" cases,
since the current state of affairs is in no way the product
of the appellants' voluntary discontinuation of their
challenged conduct.
2 
 Certainly it is not the result of any
effort on the part of the appellants to avoid review by
this Court. Thus, since these mixed mootness/ ripeness
rules are inapplicable, this case presents for me nothing
more than a plain, old-fashioned question of ripeness.

[445 U.S. 504]
 The Court's cases lay down no
mechanistic test for determining whether a dispute is
ripe for adjudication. But past formulations are
uniformly more rigorous than the one the Court now
applies. The Court has observed that "[p]ast exposure to
illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or
controversy," O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495
(1974), and that "general assertions or inferences" that
illegal conduct will recur do not render a case ripe. Id., at
497. "A hypothetical threat is not enough." Public
Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 90 (1947). There must
be "actual present or immediately threatened injury
resulting from unlawful governmental action." Laird v.
Tatum, 408, U. S. 1, 15 (1972). See Linda R. S. v.
Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 (1973) (requiring "some
threatened or actual injury"); Massachusetts v. Mellon,
262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923) (requiring that the litigant "has
sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some
direct injury"). A "substantial controversy, between
parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient
immediacy and reality" is required. Golden v. Zwickler,
394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969), quoting Maryland Casualty
Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941).
[445 U.S. 505]
 Applying these principles, I have difficulty
in perceiving an existing "case or controversy" here.
Since our remand, the state officials have indicated
nothing more than that they have a general right to
apply their statute, and to apply it to appellee if
necessary.
4 
 They have not expressed a present intent or
desire to transfer appellee to a mental facility pursuant
to the challenged provisions. Nor have they suggested
that they may transfer appellee to the Lincoln Regional
Center now on the basis of the diagnosis made five years
ago. And they have not suggested that they would
subject appellee immediately to a "fresh" psychiatric
evaluation if the District Court's injunction were lifted.
The appellee has represented that he "does not reside in
the psychiatric unit of the Nebraska Penal and
Correctional Complex, nor is he receiving or accepting
psychiatric treatment." Brief for Appellee 11-12. The
brief containing that statement was filed some six
months ago and some nine months after the revocation
of appellee's parole.
In sum, for all that appears, appellee has been
assimilated once again into the general prison
population, and appellants, at least at this time, are
content to leave him where he is.
5 
 Given these facts,
determining whether prison officials within two years
again will seek to send appellee to a mental institution
[445 U.S. 506]
 "takes us into the area of speculation and
conjecture." O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S., at 497. Cf.
Longshoremen v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222 (1954).
It is for these reasons that I would vacate the judgment
of the District Court and remand the case to that court
with directions to dismiss the complaint.
