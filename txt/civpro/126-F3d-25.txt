Bensusan Restaurant Corporation, located in New York
City, appeals from a judgment of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Stein, J.) dismissing its complaint against Richard B.
King, a Missouri resident, pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P.
12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm.
Columbia, Missouri is a small to medium size city far
distant both physically and substantively from
Manhattan. It is principally a white-collar community,
hosting among other institutions Stephens College,
Columbia College and the University of Missouri. It
would appear to be an ideal location for a small cabaret
featuring live entertainment, and King, a Columbia
resident, undoubtedly found this to be so. Since 1980, he
has operated such a club under the name "The Blue
Note" at 17 North Ninth Street in Columbia.
Plaintiff alleges in its complaint that it is "the creator of
an enormously successful jazz club in New York City
called `The Blue Note,'" which name "was registered as a
federal trademark for cabaret services on May 14, 1985."
Around 1993, a Bensusan representative wrote to King
demanding that he cease and desist from calling his club
The Blue Note. King's attorney informed the [126 F.3d
27] writer that Bensusan had no legal right to make the
demand.
Nothing further was heard from Bensusan until April
1996, when King, at the suggestion of a local web-site
design company, ThoughtPort Authority, Inc.,
permitted that company to create a web-site or
cyberspot on the internet for King's cabaret. This work
was done in Missouri. Bensusan then brought the
instant action in the Southern District of New York,
alleging violations of sections 32(1) and 43(a) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) & 1125(a), and
section 3(c) of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of
1995, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), as well as common law unfair
competition.
In addition to seeking trebled compensatory damages,
punitive damages, costs and attorney's fees, Bensusan
requests that King be enjoined from:
using the mark "The Blue Note", or any other indicia of the Blue
Note in any manner likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,
or to deceive, or from otherwise representing to the public in any
way that [King's club] is in any way sponsored, endorsed, approved,
or authorized by, or affiliated or connected with, Plaintiff or its
CABARET, by means of using any name, trademark, or service
mark of Plaintiff or any other names whatsoever, including but not
limited to removal of Defendant's web-site....
The web-site describes King's establishment as "MidMissouri's
finest live entertainment venue, ... [l]ocated
in beautiful Columbia, Missouri," and it contains
monthly calendars of future events and the Missouri
telephone number of King's box office. Initially, it
contained the following text:
The Blue Note's CyberSpot should not be confused with one of the
world's finest jazz club Blue Note, located in the heart of New
York's Greenwich Village. If you should ever find yourself in the
big apple give them a visit.
This text was followed by a hyperlink that could be
used to connect a reader's computer to a web-site
maintained by Bensusan. When Bensusan objected to
the above-quoted language, King reworded the
disclaimer and removed the hyperlink, substituting the
following disclaimer that continues in use:
The Blue Note, Columbia, Missouri should not be confused in any
way, shape, or form with Blue Note Records or the jazz club, Blue
Note, located in New York. The CyberSpot is created to provide
information for Columbia, Missouri area individuals only, any
other assumptions are purely coincidental.
The district court dismissed the complaint in a scholarly
opinion that was published in 937 F.Supp. 295 (1996).
Although we realize that attempting to apply established
trademark law in the fast-developing world of the
internet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus,
we believe that well-established doctrines of personal
jurisdiction law support the result reached by the district
court.
In diversity or federal question cases the court must look
first to the long-arm statute of the forum state, in this
instance, New York. PDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander, 103
F.3d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir.1997). If the exercise of
jurisdiction is appropriate under that statute, the court
then must decide whether such exercise comports with
the requisites of due process. See Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.),
cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 508, 136 L.Ed.2d
398 (1996). Because we believe that the exercise of
personal jurisdiction in the instant case is proscribed by
the law of New York, we do not address the issue of due
process.
The New York law dealing with personal jurisdiction
based upon tortious acts of a non-domiciliary who does
not transact business in New York is contained in subparagraphs
(a)(2) and (a)(3) of CPLR § 302, and
Bensusan claims jurisdiction with some degree of
inconsistency under both sub-paragraphs. Because King
does not transact business in New York State, Bensusan
[126 F.3d 28] makes no claim under section 302(a)(1).
The legislative intent behind the enactment of subparagraphs
(a)(2) and (a)(3) best can be gleaned by
reviewing their disparate backgrounds. Sub-paragraph
(a)(2), enacted in 1962, provides in pertinent part that a
New York court may exercise personal jurisdiction over
a non-domiciliary who "in person or though an agent"
commits a tortious act within the state. The New York
Court of Appeals has construed this provision in several
cases. In Feathers v. McLucas, 15 N.Y.2d 443, 458, 261
N.Y.S.2d 8, 209 N.E.2d 68 (1965), the Court held that
the language "commits a tortious act within the state," as
contained in sub-paragraph (a)(2), is "plain and precise"
and confers personal jurisdiction over non-residents
"when they commit acts within the state." Id. at 460, 261
N.Y.S.2d 8, 209 N.E.2d 68 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Feathers adopted the view that CPLR §
302(a)(2) reaches only tortious acts performed by a
defendant who was physically present in New York
when he performed the wrongful act. The official
Practice Commentary to CPLR § 302 explains that "if a
New Jersey domiciliary were to lob a bazooka shell
across the Hudson River at Grant's tomb, Feathers
would appear to bar the New York courts from asserting
personal jurisdiction over the New Jersey domiciliary in
an action by an injured New York plaintiff." C302:17.
The comment goes on to conclude that:
As construed by the Feathers decision, jurisdiction cannot be
asserted over a non-resident under this provision unless the
nonresident commits an act in this state. This is tantamount to a
requirement that the defendant or his agent be physically present in
New York.... In short, the failure to perform a duty in New York is
not a tortious act in this state, under the cases, unless the defendant
or his agent enters the state.
The Court of Appeals adhered to the Feathers holding
in Kramer v. Vogl, 17 N.Y.2d 27, 31, 267 N.Y.S.2d 900,
215 N.E.2d 159 (1966), and again in Platt Corp. v. Platt,
17 N.Y.2d 234, 237, 270 N.Y.S.2d 408, 217 N.E.2d 134
(1966), where it said:
The failure of a man to do anything at all when he is physically in
one State is not an "act" done or "committed" in another State. His
decision not to act and his not acting are both personal events
occurring in the physical situs. That they may have consequences
elsewhere does not alter their personal localization as acts.

26 N.Y.2d 280, 285, 309 N.Y.S.2d 913, 258 N.E.2d 202
(1970).
In Harvey v. Chemie Grunenthal, G.m.b.H, 354 F.2d
428, 431 (2d Cir.1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1001, 86
S.Ct. 1923, 16 L.Ed.2d 1015 (1966), we held that this
construction of sub-paragraph (a)(2) should be followed.
Numerous lower courts, both state and federal, have
arrived at the same conclusion. See Beckett v. Prudential
Ins. Co., 893 F.Supp. 234, 239 (S.D.N.Y.1995); Kinetic

In 1990, Judge McLaughlin, who wrote the abovequoted
commentary on section 302(a)(2), further
evidenced his belief that the commentary correctly
interpreted the statute when he quoted its substance in
Twine v. Levy, 746 F.Supp. 1202, 1206 (E.D.N.Y.1990).
As recently as 1996, another of our district judges flatly
stated: [126 F.3d 29] To subject non-residents to New
York jurisdiction under § 302(a)(2) the defendant must
commit the tort while he or she is physically in New
York State.
Carlson v. Cuevas, 932 F.Supp. 76, 80
(S.D.N.Y.1996)(Baer, J.).
Like the district court in Bulk Oil, supra, 584 F.Supp. at
41, we recognize that the interpretation of subparagraph
(a)(2) in the line of cases above cited has not
been adopted by every district judge in the Second
Circuit. However, the judges who differ are in the
minority. In the absence of some indication by the New
York Court of Appeals that its decisions in Feathers and
Platt, as interpreted and construed in the above-cited
majority of cases, no longer represent the law of New
York, we believe it would be impolitic for this Court to
hold otherwise. Applying these principles, we conclude
that Bensusan has failed to allege that King or his agents
committed a tortious act in New York as required for
exercise of personal jurisdiction under CPLR §
302(a)(2). The acts giving rise to Bensusan's lawsuit —
including the authorization and creation of King's web
site, the use of the words "Blue Note" and the Blue Note
logo on the site, and the creation of a hyperlink to
Bensusan's web site — were performed by persons
physically present in Missouri and not in New York.
Even if Bensusan suffered injury in New York, that does
not establish a tortious act in the state of New York
within the meaning of § 302(a)(2). See Feathers, 15
N.Y.2d at 460, 261 N.Y.S.2d 8, 209 N.E.2d 68.
Bensusan's claims under sub-paragraph (a)(3) can be
quickly disposed of. Sub-paragraph (a)(2) left a
substantial gap in New York's possible exercise of
jurisdiction over non-residents because it did not cover
the tort of a non-resident that took place outside of New
York but caused injury inside the state. Accordingly, in
1966 the New York Legislature enacted sub-paragraph
(a)(3), which provides in pertinent part that New York
courts may exercise jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary
who commits a tortious act without the state, causing
injury to person or property within the state. However,
once again the Legislature limited its exercise of
jurisdictional largess. Insofar as is pertinent herein it
restricted the exercise of jurisdiction under subparagraph
(a)(3) to persons who expect or should
reasonably expect the tortious act to have consequences
in the state and in addition derive substantial revenue
from interstate commerce. To satisfy the latter
requirement, Bensusan relies on the arguments that
King participated in interstate commerce by hiring
bands of national stature and received revenue from
customers — students of the University of Missouri —
who, while residing in Missouri, were domiciliaries of
other states. These alleged facts were not sufficient to
establish that substantial revenues were derived from
interstate commerce, a requirement that "is intended to
exclude non-domiciliaries whose business operations
are of a local character." Report of the Administrative
Board of the Judicial Conference of the State of New
York for the Judicial Year July 1, 1965 through June 30,
1966, Legislative Document (1967) No. 90. See United
Bank of Kuwait v. James M. Bridges, Ltd., 766 F.Supp.
113, 117-18 (S.D.N.Y.1991); Markham v. Gray, 393
F.Supp. 163, 166 (W.D.N.Y.1975). King's "Blue Note"
cafe was unquestionably a local operation.
For all the reasons above stated, we affirm the judgment
of the district court.
