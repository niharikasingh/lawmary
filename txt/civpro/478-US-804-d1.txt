Article III, § 2, of the Constitution provides that the
federal judicial power shall extend to "all Cases, in Law
and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of
the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be
made, under their Authority." We have long recognized
the great breadth of this grant of jurisdiction, holding
that there is federal jurisdiction whenever a federal
question is an "ingredient" of the action, Osborn v. Bank
of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), and
suggesting that there may even be jurisdiction simply
because a case involves "potential federal questions,"
Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 471
(1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); see also Osborn,
supra, at 824; Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304
(1816); Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U.S. 1
(1885); Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461
U.S. 480, 492-493 (1983).
Title 28 U. S. C. § 1331 provides, in language that
parrots the language of Article III, that the district
courts shall have original jurisdiction "of all civil actions
arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States." Although this language suggests that
Congress intended in § 1331 to confer upon federal
courts the full breadth of permissible "federal question"
jurisdiction (an inference that is supported by the
contemporary evidence, see Franchise Tax Board v.
Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 8, n.
8 (1983); Forrester, The Nature of a "Federal Question,"
16 Tulane L. Rev. 362, 374-376 (1942); Shapiro,
Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 568
(1985)), § 1331 has been construed more narrowly than
its constitutional counterpart. See Verlinden B. V.,
supra, at 494-495; Romero v. International Terminal
Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 379 (1959). Nonetheless,
given the language of the statute and its close relation to
the constitutional grant of federal-question jurisdiction,
limitations on federal-question jurisdiction under §
1331 must be justified by careful consideration of the
reasons [478 U.S. 819] underlying the grant of
jurisdiction and the need for federal review. Ibid. I
believe that the limitation on federal jurisdiction
recognized by the Court today is inconsistent with the
purposes of § 1331. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.
I
While the majority of cases covered by § 1331 may well
be described by Justice Holmes' adage that "[a] suit arises
under the law that creates the cause of action,"
American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241
U.S. 257, 260 (1916), it is firmly settled that there may
be federal-question jurisdiction even though both the
right asserted and the remedy sought by the plaintiff are
state created. See C. Wright, Federal Courts § 17, pp.
95-96 (4th ed. 1983) (hereinafter Wright); M. Redish,
Federal Jurisdiction: Tensions in the Allocation of
Judicial Power 64-71 (1980) (hereinafter Redish). The
rule as to such cases was stated in what Judge Friendly
described as "[t]he path-breaking opinion" in Smith v.
Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180 (1921). T. B.
Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 827 (CA2 1964). In
Smith, a shareholder of the defendant corporation
brought suit in the federal court to enjoin the defendant
from investing corporate funds in bonds issued under
the authority of the Federal Farm Loan Act. The
plaintiff alleged that Missouri law imposed a fiduciary
duty on the corporation to invest only in bonds that
were authorized by a valid law and argued that, because
the Farm Loan Act was unconstitutional, the defendant
could not purchase bonds issued under its authority.
Although the cause of action was wholly state created,
the Court held that there was original federal
jurisdiction over the case:
"The general rule is that where it appears from the bill or statement
of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the
construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the
United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable,
and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has
jurisdiction [478 U.S. 820] under [the statute granting federal
question jurisdiction]." 255 U. S., at 199.
The continuing vitality of Smith is beyond challenge.
We have cited it approvingly on numerous occasions,
and reaffirmed its holding several times — most recently
just three Terms ago by a unanimous Court in Franchise
Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust,
supra, at 9. See American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 256 U.S. 350, 357 (1921); Bell

(plurality opinion); Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc.,
372 U.S. 682, 696 (1963); Duke Power Co. v. Carolina

(1978). See also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 356
(1936) (separate opinion of McReynolds, J.); Textile

dissenting); Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S. 647, 659
(1963) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Cf. Gully v. First
National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 112 (1936) ("To bring a
case within [§ 1331], a right or immunity created by the
Constitution or laws of the United States must be an
element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause of
action"). Moreover, in addition to Judge Friendly's
authoritative opinion in T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu,
supra, at 827, Smith has been widely cited and followed
in the lower federal courts. See, e. g., Hanes Corp. v.

[478 U.S. 822] There is, to my mind, no question that
there is federal jurisdiction over the respondents' fourth
cause of action under the rule set forth in Smith and
reaffirmed in Franchise Tax [478 U.S. 823] Board.
Respondents pleaded that petitioner's labeling of the
drug Bendectin constituted "misbranding" in violation
of §§ 201 and 502(f)(2) and (j) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as
amended, 21 U. S. C. § 301 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp.
III), and that this violation "directly and proximately
caused" their injuries. App. 21-22 (Thompson
complaint), 31-32 (MacTavish complaint). Respondents
asserted in the complaint that this violation established
petitioner's negligence per se and entitled them to
recover damages without more. Ibid. No other basis for
finding petitioner negligent was asserted in connection
with this claim. As pleaded, then, respondents' "right to
relief depend[ed] upon the construction or application
of the Constitution or laws of the United States." Smith,
255 U. S., at 199; see also Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.
S., at 28 (there is federal jurisdiction under § 1331 where
the plaintiff's right to relief "necessarily depends" upon
resolution of a federal question).2 Furthermore,
although petitioner disputes its liability under the
FDCA, it concedes that respondents' claim that
petitioner violated the FDCA is "colorable, and rests
upon a reasonable foundation." Smith, supra, at 199.3
[478 U.S. 824] Of course, since petitioner must make
this concession to prevail in this Court, it need not be
accepted at face value. However, independent
examination of respondents' claim substantiates the
conclusion that it is neither frivolous nor meritless. As
stated in the complaint, a drug is "misbranded" under
the FDCA if "the labeling or advertising fails to reveal
facts material . . . with respect to consequences which
may result from the use of the article to which the
labeling or advertising relates . . . ." 21 U. S. C. § 321(n).
Obviously, the possibility that a mother's ingestion of
Bendectin during pregnancy could produce malformed
children is material. Petitioner's principal defense is that
the Act does not govern the branding of drugs that are
sold in foreign countries. It is certainly not immediately
obvious whether this argument is correct. Thus, the
statutory question is one which "discloses a need for
determining the meaning or application of [the
FDCA]," T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d, at 827,
and the claim raised by the fourth cause of action is one
"arising under" federal law within the meaning of §
1331.
II
The Court apparently does not disagree with any of this
— except, of course, for the conclusion. According to the
Court, if we assume that Congress did not intend that
there be a private federal cause of action under a
particular federal law (and, presumably, a fortiori if
Congress' decision not to create a private remedy is
express), we must also assume that Congress did not
intend that there be federal jurisdiction over a state
cause of action that is determined by that federal law.
Therefore, assuming — only because the parties [478
U.S. 825] have made a similar assumption — that there is
no private cause of action under the FDCA,4 the Court
holds that there is no federal jurisdiction over the
plaintiffs' claim:
"The significance of the necessary assumption that there is no
federal private cause of action thus cannot be overstated. For the
ultimate import of such a conclusion, as we have repeatedly
emphasized, is that it would flout congressional intent to provide a
private federal remedy for the violation of the federal statute. We
think it would similarly flout, or at least undermine, congressional
intent to conclude that the federal courts might nevertheless
exercise federal-question jurisdiction and provide remedies for
violations of that federal statute solely because the violation of the
federal statute is said to be a `rebuttable presumption' or a
`proximate cause' under state law, rather than a federal action under
federal law." Ante, at 812 (footnotes omitted).
The Court nowhere explains the basis for this
conclusion. Yet it is hardly self-evident. Why should the
fact that Congress chose not to create a private federal
remedy mean that Congress would not want there to be
federal jurisdiction to adjudicate a state claim that
imposes liability for violating the federal law? Clearly,
the decision not to provide a private federal remedy
should not affect federal jurisdiction unless the reasons
Congress withholds a federal remedy are also reasons
for withholding federal jurisdiction. Thus, it is necessary
[478 U.S. 826] to examine the reasons for Congress'
decisions to grant or withhold both federal jurisdiction
and private remedies, something the Court has not
done.
A
In the early days of our Republic, Congress was content
to leave the task of interpreting and applying federal
laws in the first instance to the state courts; with one
short-lived exception,5 Congress did not grant the
inferior federal courts original jurisdiction over cases
arising under federal law until 1875. Judiciary Act of
1875, ch. 137, § 1, 18 Stat. 470. The reasons Congress
found it necessary to add this jurisdiction to the district
courts are well known. First, Congress recognized "the
importance, and even necessity of uniformity of
decisions throughout the whole United States, upon all
subjects within the purview of the constitution." Martin
v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat., at 347-348 (Story, J.)
(emphasis in original). See also, Comment, Federal
Preemption, Removal Jurisdiction, and the WellPleaded
Complaint Rule, 51 U. Chi. L. Rev. 634, 636
(1984) (hereinafter Comment); D. Currie, Federal
Courts 160 (3d ed. 1982) (hereinafter Currie).
Concededly, because federal jurisdiction is not always
exclusive and because federal courts may disagree with
one another, absolute uniformity has not been obtained
even under § 1331. However, while perfect uniformity
may not have been achieved, experience indicates that
the availability of a federal forum in federal-question
cases has done much to advance that goal. This, in fact,
was the conclusion of the American Law Institute's
Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and
Federal Courts. ALI 164-168.
In addition, § 1331 has provided for adjudication in a
forum that specializes in federal law and that is therefore
more likely to apply that law correctly. Because federal-
question [478 U.S. 827] cases constitute the basic grist
for federal tribunals, "[t]he federal courts have acquired
a considerable expertness in the interpretation and
application of federal law." Id., at 164-165. By contrast,
"it is apparent that federal question cases must form a
very small part of the business of [state] courts." Id., at
165. As a result, the federal courts are comparatively
more skilled at interpreting and applying federal law,
and are much more likely correctly to divine Congress'
intent in enacting legislation.6 See ibid.; Redish 71;
Currie 160; Comment 636; Hornstein, Federalism,
Judicial Power and the "Arising Under" Jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts: A Hierarchical Analysis, 56 Ind. L. J.
563, 564-565 (1981).
These reasons for having original federal-question
jurisdiction explain why cases like this one and Smith —
i. e., cases where the cause of action is a creature of state
law, but an [478 U.S. 828] essential element of the claim
is federal — "arise under" federal law within the
meaning of § 1331. Congress passes laws in order to
shape behavior; a federal law expresses Congress'
determination that there is a federal interest in having
individuals or other entities conform their actions to a
particular norm established by that law. Because all laws
are imprecise to some degree, disputes inevitably arise
over what specifically Congress intended to require or
permit. It is the duty of courts to interpret these laws
and apply them in such a way that the congressional
purpose is realized. As noted above, Congress granted
the district courts power to hear cases "arising under"
federal law in order to enhance the likelihood that
federal laws would be interpreted more correctly and
applied more uniformly. In other words, Congress
determined that the availability of a federal forum to
adjudicate cases involving federal questions would make
it more likely that federal laws would shape behavior in
the way that Congress intended.
By making federal law an essential element of a statelaw
claim, the State places the federal law into a context
where it will operate to shape behavior: the threat of
liability will force individuals to conform their conduct
to interpretations of the federal law made by courts
adjudicating the state-law claim. It will not matter to an
individual found liable whether the officer who arrives
at his door to execute judgment is wearing a state or a
federal uniform; all he cares about is the fact that a
sanction is being imposed — and may be imposed again
in the future — because he failed to comply with the
federal law. Consequently, the possibility that the federal
law will be incorrectly interpreted in the context of
adjudicating the state-law claim implicates the concerns
that led Congress to grant the district courts power to
adjudicate cases involving federal questions in precisely
the same way as if it was federal law that "created" the
cause of action. It therefore follows that there is federal
jurisdiction under § 1331.
[478 U.S. 829] B
The only remaining question is whether the assumption
that Congress decided not to create a private cause of
action alters this analysis in a way that makes it
inappropriate to exercise original federal jurisdiction.
According to the Court, "the very reasons for the
development of the modern implied remedy doctrine"
support the conclusion that, where the legislative
history of a particular law shows (whether expressly or
by inference) that Congress intended that there be no
private federal remedy, it must also mean that Congress
would not want federal courts to exercise jurisdiction
over a state-law claim making violations of that federal
law actionable. Ante, at 811. These reasons are " `the
increased complexity of federal legislation,' " " `the
increased volume of federal litigation,' " and " `the
desirability of a more careful scrutiny of legislative
intent.' " Ibid. (quoting Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 377 (1982)).
These reasons simply do not justify the Court's holding.
Given the relative expertise of the federal courts in
interpreting federal law, supra, at 826-827, the increased
complexity of federal legislation argues rather strongly
in favor of recognizing federal jurisdiction. And, while
the increased volume of litigation may appropriately be
considered in connection with reasoned arguments that
justify limiting the reach of § 1331, I do not believe that
the day has yet arrived when this Court may trim a
statute solely because it thinks that Congress made it too
broad.7
[478 U.S. 830] This leaves only the third reason: " `the
desirability of a more careful scrutiny of legislative
intent.' " Ante, at 811. I certainly subscribe to the
proposition that the Court should consider legislative
intent in determining whether or not there is
jurisdiction under § 1331. But the Court has not
examined the purposes underlying either the FDCA or §
1331 in reaching its conclusion that Congress' presumed
decision not to provide a private federal remedy under
the FDCA must be taken to withdraw federal
jurisdiction over a private state remedy that imposes
liability for violating the FDCA. Moreover, such an
examination demonstrates not only that it is consistent
with legislative intent to find that there is federal
jurisdiction over such a claim, but, indeed, that it is the
Court's contrary conclusion that is inconsistent with
congressional intent.
The enforcement scheme established by the FDCA is
typical of other, similarly broad regulatory schemes.
Primary responsibility for overseeing implementation of
the Act has been conferred upon a specialized
administrative agency, here the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).8 Congress has provided the
FDA with a wide-ranging arsenal of weapons to combat
violations of the FDCA, including authority to obtain an
ex parte court order for the seizure of goods subject to
the Act, see 21 U. S. C. § 334, authority to initiate
proceedings in a federal district court to enjoin
continuing violations of the FDCA, see § 332, and
authority to request a United States Attorney to bring
criminal proceedings against violators, see § 333. See
generally 1 J. O'Reilly, Food and Drug Administration,
chs. 6-10 (1979 and Supp. 1985). Significantly, the FDA
has no independent enforcement authority; final
enforcement must come from the federal courts. [478
U.S. 831] which have exclusive jurisdiction over actions
under the FDCA. See §§ 332(a), 333, 334(a)(1). Thus,
while the initial interpretive function has been delegated
to an expert administrative body whose interpretations
are entitled to considerable deference, final
responsibility for interpreting the statute in order to
carry out the legislative mandate belongs to the federal
courts. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, n. 9 (1984)
("The judiciary is the final authority on issues of
statutory construction and must reject administrative
constructions which are contrary to clear congressional
intent").
Given that Congress structured the FDCA so that all
express remedies are provided by the federal courts, it
seems rather strange to conclude that it either "flout[s]"
or "undermine[s]" congressional intent for the federal
courts to adjudicate a private state-law remedy that is
based upon violating the FDCA. See ante, at 812. That
is, assuming that a state cause of action based on the
FDCA is not preempted, it is entirely consistent with
the FDCA to find that it "arises under" federal law
within the meaning of § 1331. Indeed, it is the Court's
conclusion that such a state cause of action must be kept
out of the federal courts that appears contrary to
legislative intent inasmuch as the enforcement
provisions of the FDCA quite clearly express a
preference for having federal courts interpret the FDCA
and provide remedies for its violation.
It may be that a decision by Congress not to create a
private remedy is intended to preclude all private
enforcement. If that is so, then a state cause of action
that makes relief available to private individuals for
violations of the FDCA is pre-empted. But if Congress'
decision not to provide a private federal remedy does
not pre-empt such a state remedy, then, in light of the
FDCA's clear policy of relying on the federal courts for
enforcement, it also should not foreclose federal
jurisdiction over that state remedy. Both § 1331 and the
enforcement provisions of the FDCA reflect Congress'
strong [478 U.S. 832] desire to utilize the federal courts
to interpret and enforce the FDCA, and it is therefore at
odds with both these statutes to recognize a private
state-law remedy for violating the FDCA but to hold
that this remedy cannot be adjudicated in the federal
courts.
The Court's contrary conclusion requires inferring from
Congress' decision not to create a private federal remedy
that, while some private enforcement is permissible in
state courts, it is "bad" if that enforcement comes from
the federal courts. But that is simply illogical. Congress'
decision to withhold a private right of action and to rely
instead on public enforcement reflects congressional
concern with obtaining more accurate implementation
and more coordinated enforcement of a regulatory
scheme. See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.
National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453,
462-465 (1974); Holloway v. Bristol-Myers Corp., 158
U. S. App. D. C. 207, 218-220, 485 F.2d 986, 997-999
(1973); Stewart & Sunstein, Public Programs and Private
Rights, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1193, 1208-1209 (1982). These
reasons are closely related to the Congress' reasons for
giving federal courts original federal-question
jurisdiction. Thus, if anything, Congress' decision not to
create a private remedy strengthens the argument in
favor of finding federal jurisdiction over a state remedy
that is not pre-empted.
