I respectfully dissent.
The life of the law is logic, it has been said. See Davis v.
Aiken, 111 Ga.App. 505, 142 S.E.2d 112, 119 (1965)
(quoting Sir Edward Coke). If so, it should be applied
here.
The majority quotes with approval the general rule that
whether money found is treasure trove, mislaid,
abandoned, or lost property is a fact question. 1
Am.Jur.2d [534 N.W.2d 409] Abandoned, Lost, and
Unclaimed Property ยง 41, at 49 (2d ed. 1994). In
deciding a fact question, we are to consider the facts as
known and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from
them. Wright v. Thompson, 254 Iowa 342, 347, 117
N.W.2d 520, 523 (1962). Thus does logic, reason, and
common sense enter in.
After considering the four categories of found money,
the majority decides that Benjamin found mislaid
money. The result is that the bank gets all the money;
Benjamin, the finder, gets nothing. Apart from the
obvious unfairness in result, I believe this conclusion
fails to come from logical analysis.
Mislaid property is property voluntarily put in a certain
place by the owner who then overlooks or forgets where
the property is. Ritz v. Selma United Methodist Church,
467 N.W.2d 266, 268 (Iowa 1991). The property here
consisted of two packets of paper currency totalling
$18,910, three to four inches high, wrapped in
aluminum foil. Inside the foil, the paper currency,
predominantly twenty dollar bills, was tied with string
and wrapped in handkerchiefs. Most of the mint dates
were in the 1950s with one dated 1934. These packets
were found in the left wing of the Mooney airplane after
Benjamin removed a panel held in by rusty screws.
These facts satisfy the requirement that the property
was voluntarily put in a certain place by the owner. But
the second test for determining that property is mislaid
is that the owner "overlooks or forgets where the
property is." See Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269. I do not
believe that the facts, logic, or common sense lead to a
finding that this requirement is met. It is not likely or
reasonable to suppose that a person would secrete
$18,000 in an airplane wing and then forget where it
was.
Cases cited by the majority contrasting "mislaid"
property and "lost" property are appropriate for a
comparison of these principles but do not foreclose
other considerations. After finding the money,
Benjamin proceeded to give written notice of finding
the property as prescribed in Iowa Code chapter 644
(1993), "Lost Property." As set out in section 556F.8,
notices were posted on the courthouse door and in three
other public places in the county. In addition, notice was
published once each week for three consecutive weeks
in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
Also, affidavits of publication were filed with the county
auditor who then had them published as part of the
board of supervisors' proceedings. Iowa Code ยง 556F.9.
After twelve months, if no person appears to claim and
prove ownership of the property, the right to the
property rests irrevocably in the finder. Iowa Code ยง
556F.11.
The purpose of this type of legal notice is to give people
the opportunity to assert a claim if they have one. See,
e.g., Neeley v. Murchison, 815 F.2d 345, 347 (5th
Cir.1987). If no claim is made, the law presumes there is
none or for whatever reason it is not asserted. Thus, a
failure to make a claim after legal notice is given is a bar
to a claim made thereafter. See, e.g., Tulsa Professional
Collection Servs., Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 481, 108
S.Ct. 1340, 1343, 99 L.Ed.2d 565, 572-73 (1988).
Benjamin followed the law in giving legal notice of
finding property. None of the parties dispute this. The
suggestion that Benjamin should have initiated a further
search for the true owner is not a requirement of the
law, is therefore irrelevant, and in no way diminishes
Benjamin's rights as finder.
The scenario unfolded in this case convinces me that the
money found in the airplane wing was abandoned.
Property is abandoned when the owner no longer wants
to possess it. See Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269; Pearson v.
City of Guttenberg, 245 N.W.2d 519, 529 (Iowa 1976).
The money had been there for years, possibly thirty. No
owner had claimed it in that time. No claim was made
by the owner after legally prescribed notice was given
that it had been found. Thereafter, logic and the law
support a finding that the owner has voluntarily
relinquished all right, title, and interest in the property.
Whether the money was abandoned due to its
connection to illegal drug trafficking or is otherwise
contraband property is a matter for speculation. In any
event, abandonment by the true owner has legally
occurred and been established.
[534 N.W.2d 410] I would hold that Benjamin is legally
entitled to the entire amount of money that he found in
the airplane wing as the owner of abandoned property.
