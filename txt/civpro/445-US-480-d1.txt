It seems clear to me that this case is now moot.
Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment and remand
the case to 
[445 U.S. 501]
 the District Court with
directions to dismiss the complaint. United States v.
Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36.
As the Court points out, this is not a class action, and
the appellee is now incarcerated in the Nebraska Penal
and Correctional Complex with an anticipated release
date in March 1982. See ante, at 485-487, and n. 3. In
that status, the appellee is simply one of thousands of
Nebraska prisoners, with no more standing than any
other to attack the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. 
ยง
83-180 (1) (1976) on the sole basis of the mere
possibility that someday that statute might be invoked to
transfer him to another institution.
Although the appellee was once transferred in accord
with 
ยง
 83-180 (1), there is no demonstrated probability
that that will ever happen again. Weinstein v. Bradford,
423 U.S. 147. And this case is not one that by its nature
falls within the ambit of the "capable of repetition, yet
evading review" exception to established principles of
mootness. See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC,
219 U.S. 498; Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle,
416 U.S. 115. If the appellee should again be threatened
with transfer under the allegedly infirm statute, there
will be ample time to reach the merits of his claim.
