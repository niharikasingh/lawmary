Plaintiff brought an action against his employer in a
California state court. He alleged that his employer had
breached his employment contract by paying him less
than the contract required. The employer removed the
case to federal district court on the ground that plaintiff
had artfully pleaded what was in reality a challenge to
the employer's compliance with federal law requiring
the withholding of federal income tax. The district court
denied plaintiff's motion to remand, dismissed the
action, and awarded attorney's fees to the employer. We
affirm and impose sanctions.
BACKGROUND
On November 7, 1983, Willie D. Bright entered into an
employment contract with Bechtel Petroleum, Inc.
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. On
January 3, 1984, Bright provided to Bechtel a federal
Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (W-4
Form) on which he claimed an exemption from the
withholding of federal income tax.
In accordance with federal internal revenue regulations,
Bechtel forwarded Bright's W-4 Form to the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). On March 14, 1984, the IRS
issued a directive to Bechtel declaring Bright's W-4
Form invalid and ordering Bechtel to begin withholding
federal income tax. Pursuant to a California state income
tax regulation, Bechtel also began withholding state
income tax. In 1984, a total of $2,486.18 in federal tax
and $736.00 in state tax was withheld from Bright's
wages.
On June 1, 1984, Bright filed an action against Bechtel,
and certain individual agents, in California Superior
Court alleging a breach of contract. Bechtel removed the
case to the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California on the ground that the true basis
of the complaint was that Bechtel had complied with
federal income tax laws in withholding tax from Bright's
wages. Bechtel also moved for dismissal of the action,
and for an award of costs and attorney's fees on the
ground the complaint was frivolous and filed in bad
faith.
Bright moved to remand the case back to state court,
arguing that he desired to litigate only the question of
Bechtel's withholding of state income tax from his
wages.
On December 4, 1984, the district court denied Bright's
motion to remand, granted the motion to dismiss, and
awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $3300 to
Bechtel.
On December 19, 1984, Bright filed a motion asking the
court for "clarification" of the grounds of its judgment.
Before the district court had ruled on this motion,
Bright filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. The
court subsequently denied Bright's motion. Bright also
filed a notice of appeal from that order. The two appeals
have been consolidated.
ANALYSIS
A. Standard of Review
A question of federal subject matter jurisdiction, such as
that permitting removal of a case from state to federal
court, is reviewable de novo. See Mobil Oil Corp. v. City
of Long Beach, 772 F.2d 534, 538 (9th Cir.1985). This
court reviews de novo a district court's ruling on a
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted. Trerice v. Pedersen, 769 F.2d
1398, 1400 (9th Cir.1985).
B. Removal of the Case — Federal Question Jurisdiction
Bright's complaint alleges that Bechtel breached the
employment contract by "issuing [780 F.2d 769] to
plaintiff paychecks that were in amounts less than
contracted and agreed for." The complaint alleges a
cause of action based upon "breach of contract and a
gross violation of Christian principles."
Bechtel petitioned to remove the case to federal district
court on the ground that the "breach" Bright alleges is
based upon Bechtel's withholding of income tax
pursuant to federal law. Bechtel contends the action falls
within the district court's original jurisdiction because it
"arises under" federal internal revenue statutes.1
An action may "arise under" a law of the United States if
the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily turns on
construction of federal law. Franchise Tax Board v.
Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 9,
103 S.Ct. 2841, 2846, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983); Mobil Oil
Corp. v. City of Long Beach, 772 F.2d 534, 539 (9th
Cir.1985). Under the "well-pleaded complaint" rule, the
federal question, which invokes federal jurisdiction,
must appear from the complaint and not from any
federal defense the defendant might raise to defeat the
claim. Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 10, 103 S.Ct. at
2846; Mobil Oil Corp., 772 F.2d at 538-39.
Although the plaintiff is generally considered the
"master of his complaint" and is free to choose the
forum for his action, this principle is not without
limitation. Schroeder v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 702
F.2d 189, 190 (9th Cir.1983).2 A plaintiff will not be
allowed to conceal the true nature of a complaint
through "artful pleading." Id. at 191; see also Olguin v.
Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co., 740 F.2d 1468,
1472 (9th Cir.1984).
Bechtel, through background information in its petition
for removal and supporting affidavits,3 demonstrated
that Bright, despite "artfully pleading" his action as a
breach of contract, in fact is challenging federal income
tax withholding laws and regulations. Bright had
written two letters threatening a lawsuit for breach of
contract against Bechtel for complying with the IRS
directive to withhold income tax from his wages. Both
letters criticized the IRS directive as illegal and cited
federal internal revenue statutes. The second letter
expressly referred to a decision in this circuit,
Stonecipher v. Bray, 653 F.2d 398 (9th Cir.1981), cert.
denied, 454 U.S. 1145, 102 S.Ct. 1006, 71 L.Ed.2d 297
(1982), which dismissed a suit, similar to the instant
action, as frivolous.
In addition, affidavits were presented to the district
court showing that Bright's complaint contains language
virtually identical to that in the complaint of another
employee who had filed an action against Bechtel in
state court.4 That action had been removed to the
Northern District on the same ground, that the alleged
breach of contract derived from the company's
withholding of federal income tax from a [780 F.2d 770]
paycheck, and had been dismissed as frivolous shortly
before Bright filed the complaint in this action.
Once the removal petition had been filed, Bright
asserted for the first time that he intended only to
litigate a claim involving the withholding of California
state income tax. Thus, Bright argues, no federal
question is raised. Bright's assertion must be regarded as
disingenuous. The complaint simply does not state a
claim limited to a state tax issue. It is clear under the
circumstances that Bright has raised this new argument
as another attempt to evade the jurisdiction of the
Northern District, which has been acting swiftly to
dismiss similar suits as frivolous.
Accordingly, the removal of the action to federal court
was proper. See Chandler v. Perini Power Constructors,
Inc., 520 F.Supp. 1152, 1155 (D.N.H.1981).
C. Dismissal of Federal Tax Withholding Claim
Under 26 U.S.C. § 3402, an employer has a mandatory
duty to withhold federal income tax from an employee's
wages where required by applicable regulations. See
Maxfield v. United States Postal Service, 752 F.2d 433,
434 (9th Cir.1984); Chandler v. Perini Power
Constructors, Inc., 520 F.Supp. 1152, 1153
(D.N.H.1981). The actions taken by Bechtel, in
withholding federal income tax from Bright's wages,
were fully in accordance with federal internal revenue
regulations.5 This circuit has repeatedly held that an
employer is not liable to an employee for complying
with its legal duty to withhold tax. Maxfield, 752 F.2d at
434; see Stonecipher v. Bray, 653 F.2d 398, 403 (9th
Cir.1981) (employer has not breached employment
contract by withholding taxes from wages and paying
employee the balance), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1145, 102
S.Ct. 1006, 71 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982); Callow v. Amerace
Corp., 681 F.2d 1242, 1243 (9th Cir.1982) (affirming
dismissal of action against employer seeking to recover
withheld federal and state income tax).
The Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 3403, expressly
provides that an employer is liable to the IRS for the
payment of tax withheld, and "shall not be liable to any
person for the amount of any such payment." Thus, suits
by employees against employers for tax withheld are
"statutorily barred." Chandler, 520 F.Supp. at 1156.
In addition, we have held that actions, such as this, are
barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a),
which prohibits suits "for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any tax." Maxfield, 752 F.2d
at 434. A lawsuit, such as in the instant case, can be
viewed as one to restrain collection (through
withholding) of federal income tax. See id.; Chandler,
520 F.Supp. at 1155.
The district court properly dismissed Bright's claim
involving withholding of federal income tax.
D. Dismissal of State Tax Withholding Claim
Bright's complaint also raises a breach of contract claim
against Bechtel based on the withholding of state
income tax. Bechtel withheld state income tax in
compliance with a California state regulation, 22
Cal.Admin.Code § 4340-1(b), providing that a federal
determination that a withholding exemption claim is
invalid is also effective for state withholding purposes.
As the district court failed to remand any part of the case
to state court, and granted a final dismissal of the case,
we must assume [780 F.2d 771] the district court also
dismissed the claim involving withholding of state tax.
The district court had proper jurisdiction over the claim
for breach of contract involving state tax withholding.
Once the federal court acquires jurisdiction of a case on
removal, it also acquires jurisdiction over pendent state
law claims. Salveson v. Western States BankCard Ass'n,
731 F.2d 1423, 1430 (9th Cir.1984). Dismissal of the
federal claim does not deprive a federal court of the
power to adjudicate the remaining pendent state claims.
Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 403-04, 90 S.Ct. 1207,
1213, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); Anderson v. Allstate Ins.
Co., 630 F.2d 677, 681 (9th Cir.1980).
The claims involving withholding of state tax and of
federal tax arose out of a "common nucleus of operative
fact." See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs,
383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218
(1966). Bechtel's withholding of both taxes was based
upon the single IRS directive. The California regulation
makes the IRS determination effective for state purposes
as well. Although the funds withheld were allocated
between the IRS and the California Franchise Tax
Board, the act of withholding was a single transaction.
Furthermore, the same issue, concerning whether an
employer can be held liable in breach of contract for
complying with government regulations, is raised in the
claim involving state tax withholding. To conserve
judicial resources, it was appropriate for the district
court to decide this issue. It was not an abuse of
discretion to refuse to remand this claim to state court.
Bright argues that it is inappropriate for a federal court
to consider state tax issues. It is true that the principle of
comity generally bars challenges to the validity of state
tax systems in federal court.6 See Miller v. City of Los
Angeles, 755 F.2d 1390, 1391 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,
474 U.S. 995, 106 S.Ct. 408, 88 L.Ed.2d 359 (1985).
However, the California state income taxation system is
not at issue in this action. Bright does contend that the
regulation requiring an employer to withhold state tax if
the IRS determines an exemption claim is invalid, 22
Cal.Admin.Code § 4340-1(b), violates the California
constitution and state statutes which purportedly
prohibit such a delegation of state taxation authority to
the federal government. This is simply not relevant.
Even if the regulation is invalid, it was justifiable for
Bechtel to rely upon it and comply with its command.
The only issue raised in this action is whether an
employer can be held liable under California law for
obeying a California regulation.
One California court has recently considered a claim
similar to that brought by Bright in the instant case. In
Otworth v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., 166
Cal.App.3d 452, 167 Cal.App.3d 102E, 212 Cal.Rptr.
743, 744-45 (1985), the plaintiff alleged conversion,
breach of contract, violations of constitutional rights,
and unjust enrichment against his employer for
withholding federal and state income tax. The funds had
been turned over to the IRS and California Franchise
Tax Board. Id., 212 Cal.Rptr. at 745. The court affirmed
dismissal of these claims and imposed sanctions for
frivolous appeal. Id., 212 Cal.Rptr. at 748-49.
The court appeared to view the state tax withholding
issue as part and parcel of the federal tax withholding
dispute. Consequently, the court's conclusion that the
plaintiff failed to state a claim for breach of contract
would apply to both the withholding of federal and state
tax. The court held that, in the absence of a provision
requiring the employer to refrain from withholding, an
employer "discharges its [780 F.2d 772] contractual
obligations when it withholds taxes from the employee's
wages and pays the employee the balance." Id., 212
Cal.Rptr. at 747.
Even if a technical breach of contract were established,
Bright could not prevail in this action. Under
Cal.Civ.Code § 1511(1), no liability exists for breach of a
contract whose performance has been made impossible
by operation of law. Baird v. Wendt Enterprises, Inc.,
248 Cal.App.2d 52, 56 Cal.Rptr. 118, 120 (1967); see
generally 1 Witkin, Summary of California Law,
"Contracts," § 607, at 517 (8th ed. 1973). A party is not
required to violate the law to avoid liability for breach of
contract.7 See Northrop Corp. v. Triad Financial
Establishment, 593 F.Supp. 928, 937 (C.D.Cal.1984)
(interpreting California law).
The claim involving withholding of state tax was
properly dismissed.
E. Award of Attorney's Fees
The district court did not abuse its discretion in
awarding attorney's fees. See Callow v. Amerace Corp.,
681 F.2d 1242, 1243 (9th Cir.1982). The action is plainly
frivolous, brought in bad faith, and for the purposes of
harassment.8
The district court was made aware of another recent
judgment in the Northern District, dismissing a nearly
identically worded complaint by another Bechtel
employee, which found that there was an organized
campaign of "tax protest" lawsuits, aimed at "thwarting
federal tax regulations by inundating employers with
frivolous suits in the hope that the volume and cost of
litigation involved in defending these actions will deter
employers from withholding taxes." McFarland v.
Bechtel, 586 F.Supp. 907 (N.D.Cal.1984).
Under these circumstances, the award of attorney's fees
was "an appropriate deterrent to future frivolous suits."
Callow, 681 F.2d at 1243.
F. Denial of Motion for "Clarification"
The district court's final judgment was entered on
December 4, 1984. On December 19, 1984, Bright filed a
motion for "clarification" of the judgment. Even if this
court liberally construes Bright's motion as a motion
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b) to amend
the findings or under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the
judgment, the motion was not made within 10 days after
entry of the judgment as required by the rules.
Even had the motion been timely, it was properly
denied. Rule 52(a) provides that findings of fact and
conclusions of law are unnecessary in decisions on
motions.
G. Attorney's Fees and Costs on Appeal
"When a judgment is affirmed, this court has authority
to award fees and double costs on appeal in its discretion
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1912. Federal Rule of Appellate
Procedure 38 provides for the same remedy if the court
finds an appeal is frivolous." Maxfield v. United States
Postal Service, 752 F.2d 433, 434-35 (9th Cir.1984) This
court has imposed such sanctions previously in cases
involving similar frivolous claims against employers for
withholding income tax. Maxfield, 752 F.2d at 435;
Stonecipher v. Bray, 653 F.2d 398, 403 (9th Cir.1981),
cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1145, 102 S.Ct. 1006, 71 L.Ed.2d
297 (1982).
An award of attorney's fees is particularly warranted in
this case as Bechtel [780 F.2d 773] should not be forced
to bear the expense of this action and appeal simply
because it properly complied with federal and state law.
Bechtel is an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire
of Bright's war against the income taxation system.
Bechtel should therefore be awarded reasonable
attorney's fees and double costs on appeal. See Maxfield,
752 F.2d at 435.
In this case, Bechtel shall have 15 days following the
filing of this decision within which to submit a
declaration for attorneys' fees calculated in accordance
with the factors set forth in Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild,
Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 425
U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976).
AFFIRMED.
