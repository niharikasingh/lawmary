BACKGROUND
This is an employment discrimination action brought by
Plaintiff Lillian Pebbles Morrison pursuant to Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
§
 701 et seq., as
amended in 1991 by 42 U.S.C. 
§
 2000e, et seq. ("Title
VII"), and Ohio Rev.Code 
§
 4112 (see doc. 1). Plaintiff
originally filed her Complaint on December 11, 1998 in
the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas.
Defendant Circuit City Stores, Inc., a retailer of
consumer electronics and appliances, then removed the
case to this Court on January 12, 1999 pursuant to Title
28 U.S.C. 
§§
 1331, 1332, and 1441.
Prior to her discharge on December 12, 1997, Plaintiff
worked as a store manager for one of Defendant's
Cincinnati area 
[70 F.Supp.2d 818]
 stores. According to
Defendant, Plaintiff was 30 years old with an
undergraduate degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy
and a master's degree from Central Michigan University
when she applied for a position with Defendant on July
10, 1995 (doc. 4, Parsons Decl. 
 5 & Ex. A). Defendant
hired Plaintiff on December 1, 1995.
As part of the application and hiring process, Plaintiff
signed two identical application forms, the first on July
10, 1995 (doc. 4, Ex. A), and the second on December
27, 1995 (copy provided to the Court during the April
20, 1999 hearing). Each application sets forth identical
language about the "Circuit City Dispute Resolution
Agreement" (hereinafter, the "Agreement"). In addition,
each application states that the company will not
consider any applicant for employment unless he or she
also signs the Agreement.
The Agreement provides, in pertinent part, that an
applicant will resolve:
any and all previously unasserted claims, disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to [his or her] application or candidacy for
employment, employment and/or cessation of employment with
Circuit City, exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a
neutral Arbitrator. By way of example only, such claims include
claims under federal, state and local statutory or common law, such
as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, including the amendments of
the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Americans with Disabilities Act,
the law of contract and law of tort.
(doc. 4, Parson Decl., Ex. A) (emphasis in original).
Above the text of the Agreement, the application states
in boldface type that:
With this application you should have received the Rules and
Procedures of the Agreement. You should familiarize yourself with
these rules and procedures prior to signing the Agreement. If you
did not receive the Rules and Procedures you must request a copy
from a Circuit City representative prior to signing the Agreement.
(Id.) (emphasis in original). Once an applicant signs the
Agreement, the Agreement allows the applicant three
days in which to withdraw his or her consent to the
Agreement. The applicant may also take the application
package home and return it later with his or her
signature affixed (Id.).
Furthermore, the Agreement states that: "The Dispute
Resolution Agreement and the Dispute Resolution
Rules and Procedures affect your legal rights. You may
wish to seek legal advice before signing this Dispute
Resolution Agreement" (Id.) (emphasis in original). The
following clauses offer some detail as to how legal rights
will be affected by the Agreement:
I understand that if I do file a lawsuit regarding a dispute arising out
of or relating to my application or candidacy for employment,
employment or cessation or employment, Circuit City may use this
Agreement in support of its request to the court to dismiss the
lawsuit and require me instead to use arbitration.
* * * * * *
This Agreement will be enforceable throughout the application
process, my employment, and thereafter with respect to any claims
arising from or relating to may application or candidacy for
employment, employment or cessation of employment with Circuit
City. I then must arbitrate all employment-related claims, and I may
not file a lawsuit in court.
(Id.)
Defendant now moves this Court to compel arbitration
and stay these proceedings pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. 
§§
 3 and 4, or, in the
alternative, to dismiss this case entirely 
[70 F.Supp.2d
819]
 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Plaintiff and
Defendant are parties to this Agreement requiring them
to resolve this type of dispute through final and binding
arbitration.
Plaintiff responds that the Agreement is invalid and
unenforceable because it fails to comply with common
law principles of contract law and because it attempts to
limit Plaintiff's substantive rights and remedies.
Therefore, Plaintiff argues, the FAA does not require
that the Court stay or dismiss this action and the Court
thereby retains subject matter jurisdiction.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
A Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction attacks a plaintiff's cause of action in
one of two ways: facially or factually. Fed. R.Civ.P.
12(b)(1); United States v. Ritchie, 15 F.3d 592, 598 (6th
Cir.1994). A facial attack challenges the sufficiency of
the complaint itself. On such an attack, the court must
take all material allegations in the complaint as true and
construe them in a light most favorable to the non-
moving party. Ritchie, 15 F.3d at 598 (citing Scheuer v.
Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 235-37, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d
90 (1974)). In contrast, a factual attack challenges the
factual existence of subject matter jurisdiction. The
court reviewing such a motion need not presume that
the factual allegations set forth in the complaint are true.
Id. Instead, the court may weigh any evidence properly
before it. See Ohio Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. United States,
922 F.2d 320, 325 (6th Cir.1990); Rogers v. Stratton
Indus., Inc., 798 F.2d 913, 918 (6th Cir. 1986).
In addressing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
a court must accept all allegations in the complaint as
true and view them in a light most favorable to the party
opposing the motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); Great Lakes
Steel v. Deggendorf, 716 F.2d 1101, 1105 (6th Cir.
1983). The court may grant the motion only if "it
appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set
of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him
to relief." Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct.
99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Balderaz v. Porter, 578 F.Supp.
1491, 1494 (S.D.Ohio 1983).
In the instant matter, Defendant refutes the factual
allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint concerning the
enforceability of the Agreement. In support of its
Motion to Dismiss, Defendant submits a copy of the
application Plaintiff signed on July 10, 1995 and a
declaration from Pamela G. Parsons concerning that
application and the Agreement. Apparently because the
Agreement requires final and binding arbitration of all
employment disputes, Defendant asserts that the Court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's
Complaint, or, alternatively, that Plaintiff's Complaint
fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
As mentioned earlier, a court may consider any evidence
properly before it when a defendant factually attacks
subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).
However, evidence outside the pleadings may not be
used to support motions brought pursuant to Rule
12(b)(6) unless the evidence is referenced in the
plaintiff's complaint and is central to a plaintiff's claims.
Venture Assoc. Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 987
F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir.1993). In this case, Plaintiff
specifically references the Agreement in her Complaint
and she argues in Count I of her Complaint that the
Agreement is unenforceable. Therefore, the Court finds
that we may consider the Agreement and Ms. Parson's
declaration in deciding whether to dismiss this action
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6).
DISCUSSION
The threshold issue before the Court is the applicability
of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 U.S.C. 
§
 1 et seq.,
to the facts 
[70 F.Supp.2d 820]
 of this case. Defendant
asserts that the FAA applies to this case and that the
FAA requires the enforcement of the Agreement.
I. Federal Arbitration Act
The FAA provides that arbitration provisions in any
"contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce"
are "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract." 9 U.S.C. 
§
 2. Section 1 of the FAA,
though, excludes "contracts of employment of seamen,
railroad employees, or any other class of workers
engaged in foreign or interstate commerce" from
coverage under the FAA. 9 U.S.C. 
§
 1. Nonetheless, the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals construes this
exclusionary clause narrowly. In Asplundh Tree Expert
Co. v. Bates, 71 F.3d 592 (6th Cir.1995), the Sixth
Circuit held that:
the exclusionary clause of 
§
 1 of the Arbitration Act should be
narrowly construed to apply to employment contracts of seamen,
railroad workers, and any other class of workers actually engaged in
the movement of goods in interstate commerce in the same way
that seamen and railroad workers are.
Id., 71 F.3d at 600-601.
In the instant matter, the Court finds that Plaintiff was
not engaged in the movement of goods in interstate
commerce in the same manner of seamen and railroad
workers while she worked as a store manager for
Defendant. Therefore, the Agreement signed between
Plaintiff and Defendant for the arbitration of all
employment disputes falls within the type of contracts
contemplated by the FAA. See Cosgrove v. Shearson
Lehman Bros., No. 95-3432, 1997 WL 4783, 1997
U.S.App. LEXIS 392, at *4 (6th Cir. Jan. 6, 1997).
Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit recognizes that both
statutory and common law claims may be subject to an
arbitration agreement enforceable under the FAA. See
Cosgrove, 1997 WL 4783, 1997 U.S.App. LEXIS 392, at
*5-*6 (citing Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,
500 U.S. 20, 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991)
(holding that claims arising under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") may be
subject to an enforceable arbitration agreement); Willis
v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 948 F.2d 305, 310 (6th
Cir.1991) (extending the holding of Gilmer to claims
arising under Title VII)). The Supreme Court reiterated
in Gilmer that, "`[h]aving made the bargain to arbitrate,
the party should be held to it unless Congress itself has
evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial
remedies for the statutory rights at issue.'" Id., 500 U.S.
at 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 628, 105
S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985)).
In this case, the Agreement purports to apply to "any
and all previously unasserted claims, disputes, or
controversies arising out of or relating to [Plaintiff's]
application or candidacy for employment, employment
and/or cessation of employment with [Defendant]." The
Agreement also explicitly states that it applies to actions
brought under federal, state, and local statutory or
common law, including the ADEA, Title VII, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the law of contract, and
the law of tort.
Plaintiff's seven-count Complaint contends that
Defendant unlawfully discharged her in violation of
Title VII, Ohio Rev.Code 
§
 4112, Ohio public policy,
and Ohio common law. Because we find no evidence
that Congress intended to preclude the arbitration of
her statutory claims and because Plaintiff fails to
persuade us that Ohio would preclude the arbitration of
her state-law claims, the Court concludes that Plaintiff
should be held to her bargain unless (1) the traditional
grounds for revocation of a contract exist in this case or
(2) the Agreement fails to protect the substantive rights
guaranteed by law. See 9 U.S.C. 
§
 2; Gilmer, 500 U.S. at
28, 33, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (quoting 
[70 F.Supp.2d 821]
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.S. at 637, 627, 105 S.Ct.
3346 respectively).
II. Enforceability of the Agreement
Plaintiff urges the Court to find the Agreement
unenforceable, arguing that the Agreement is an
unconscionable adhesion contract that limits Plaintiff's
substantive rights and remedies under Title VII and
Ohio Rev.Code 
§
 4112. In addition, Plaintiff asserts that
the Agreement lacks mutuality of obligation and
consideration and impermissibly waives future rights.
Plaintiff also contends that the Agreement violates
public policy by taking away the applicant's right to a
jury trial and instead requiring final, binding arbitration.
In the following subsections, the Court addresses each of
Plaintiff's arguments separately and concludes that no
argument leads to a finding that the Agreement at issue
in this case is unenforceable.
A. Adhesion Contract
A court examines an arbitration agreement according to
state-law principles of contract formation. See First
Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943-
44, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995) (finding that
"arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the
parties"). In view of the fact that Plaintiff signed the
Agreement in Ohio and that her employment and
termination occurred in Ohio, the Court will apply the
common law of Ohio to this matter.
Plaintiff first claims that the Agreement is an
unconscionable contract of adhesion. The Ohio
Supreme Court referred to Black's Law Dictionary in
describing a contract of adhesion as a "`[s]tandardized
contract form offered ... on essentially [a] `take it or
leave it' basis.'" Sekeres v. Arbaugh, 31 Ohio St.3d 24,
31, 508 N.E.2d 941, 946 (1987) (quoting Black's Law
Dictionary 38 (5th ed.1979)). Meanwhile,
unconscionability is defined as "`an absence of
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties to a
contract, combined with contract terms that are
unreasonably favorable to the other party.'" Dorsey v.
Contemporary Obstetrics & Gynecology, Inc., 113 Ohio
App.3d 75, 80, 680 N.E.2d 240, 243 (1996) (quoting
Collins v. Click Camera & Video, Inc., 86 Ohio App.3d
826, 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294, 1299 (1993)); see also David
L. Threlkeld & Co., Inc. v. Metallgesellschaft Ltd., 923
F.2d 245, 249 (2nd Cir.1991) (finding that a plaintiff
must show "`unfairness, undue oppression, or
unconscionability'" before a federal court will strike an
arbitration agreement as a contract of adhesion)
(citations omitted).
Ohio courts conduct a two-prong inquiry into whether
a contract is unconscionable. Dorsey, 113 Ohio App.3d
at 80-81, 680 N.E.2d at 243 (citing Collins, 86 Ohio
App.3d at 834, 621 N.E.2d at 1299). The first prong
looks at whether the contract terms are so unfair and
unreasonable as to constitute substantive
unconscionability while the second prong focuses on the
relative bargaining power of the contracting parties to
determine whether procedural unconscionability exists.
Id.
In support of her argument that the Agreement is a
contract of adhesion, Plaintiff alleges that she was
"forced" to sign the Agreement as part of the application
in order to be considered for employment by Defendant.
Plaintiff also contends that Defendant, a large company
with retail facilities across the country, is more
sophisticated and maintains more bargaining power
than Plaintiff. She states that she was extremely
surprised to learn that the Agreement amounted to a
waiver of her right to a judicial forum and a jury trial.
Plaintiff further argues that the Agreement is
unconscionable because it threatens to deny her the
substantive rights and remedies provided by Title VII
and Ohio Rev.Code 
§
 4112.
In contrast, Defendant asserts that the Agreement is not
a contract of adhesion simply because Plaintiff had to
sign it before she could be considered for employment.
Defendant states that several other 
[70 F.Supp.2d 822]
electronics retailers exist in the Cincinnati area, and it
argues that Plaintiff could have applied for positions
with these retailers. Defendant cites Beauchamp v. Great
West Life Assurance Co., 918 F.Supp. 1091, 1098
(E.D.Mich.1996), and EEOC v. Frank's Nursery &
Crafts, 966 F.Supp. 500, 504 (E.D.Mich.1997) (rev'd on
other grounds, 177 F.3d 448, 454-55 (6th Cir. 1999)), in
support of the proposition that adhesion contracts do
not exist where applicants have a choice of where to
apply for a job. In Beauchamp, the court indicated its
reluctance in finding a contract of adhesion in a context
where a plaintiff could choose to work for other
employers without signing arbitration agreements. Id.,
918 F.Supp. at 1098. Likewise, the court in Frank's
Nursery & Crafts stated that "[i]f [the applicant]
disagreed with anything contained in the application she
was free to simply look elsewhere for employment. ...
(When a party ... voluntarily agrees to something in an
attempt to obtain employment, they are not being
`forced' to do anything"). Id., 966 F.Supp. at 504
(emphasis in original).
Defendant also contends that the application and its
arbitration provisions are not unconscionable just
because Plaintiff was only one of many employees
working for a large, nationwide retailer. Defendant
notes that the court in Beauchamp responded to a
similar balance-of-power argument, stating: "Under
plaintiff's theory, practically every condition of
employment would be an `adhesion contract' which
could not be enforced because it would have been
presented to the employee by the employer in a
situation of unequal bargaining power on a `take it or
leave it' basis." Id., 918 F.Supp. at 1098. Moreover, in
Gilmer, the Supreme Court stated that the "[m]ere
inequality in bargaining power ... is not a sufficient
reason to hold that arbitration agreements are never
enforceable in the employment context." Id., 500 U.S. at
33, 111 S.Ct. 1647.
Defendant further alleges that Plaintiff is "a well-
educated, mature and experienced manager, who
certainly understood the effect of the arbitration
agreement and fully appreciated her choices" (doc. 3). In
addition, Defendant argues that the Agreement signed
by both Plaintiff and Defendant pursuant to the
application was "clear and unambiguous" and could not
lead to the type of surprise Plaintiff now asserts. See
Frank's Nursery & Crafts, 966 F.Supp. at 504 (agreeing
with the Beauchamp court and stating that "[t]he simple
fact of the matter is that if [the applicant] did not
understand or intend to agree to arbitration she should
not have signed her name until she did understand or
consulted with someone.").
The Court finds Defendant's arguments persuasive, and
we conclude that Plaintiff fails to show the unfairness or
undue oppression necessary to support a finding that the
Agreement amounted to an unconscionable contract of
adhesion on a substantive or procedural basis.
Furthermore, as discussed in Subsection E, infra, we
find that the terms of the Agreement are fair and
reasonable. We also find here that the balance of power
between Plaintiff as an applicant and Defendant as a
potential employer was not so disproportionate as to
prevent a voluntary meeting of the minds on the issue of
arbitration. See Dorsey, 113 Ohio App.3d at 80, 680
N.E.2d at 243.
B. Mutuality of Obligation
Plaintiff next contends that mutuality of obligation is
lacking in the Agreement because Defendant is not
bound to the Agreement's terms. Under Ohio law, a
contract cannot be enforced without mutuality of
obligation. Thomas G. Snavely Co. v. Brown Constr.
Co., 16 Ohio Misc. 50, 55-56, 239 N.E.2d 759, 762
(1968). In Trumbull v. Century Mktg. Corp., 12
F.Supp.2d 683, 686 (N.D.Ohio 1998), a case relied upon
by Plaintiffs, the district court found that there was no
mutuality of obligation or consideration in an 
[70
F.Supp.2d 823]
 employment handbook signed by an
employee after employment began since the employer
could revoke any term at any time. Id. at 685-86.
Accordingly, the court held that the employee handbook
could not be an enforceable contract. Id. After also
finding alternatively that the employee did not
knowingly agree to arbitrate disputes and that the
arbitration process offered would limit a substantive
remedy granted by a statute, the Trumbull court denied
the defendant's motion to stay. Id. at 687-88.
Plaintiff argues here that, like the employee handbook in
Trumbull, the Agreement in this case is of a unilateral
nature. Plaintiff alleges that, while no provision exists
for an employee to alter or terminate the Agreement,
Rule 19 of the Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures
provides that:
[Defendant] may alter or terminate the agreement and these
Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures on December 31st of any
year upon giving 30 calendar days written notice to associates.
Thus, Plaintiff asserts, the Agreement cannot be
enforced because mutuality of obligation is lacking.
In response, Defendant argues that mutuality of
obligation is maintained because Defendant can only
modify or terminate the Agreement or the Rules and
Procedures at a certain time each year and only upon 30
days' notice to each employee. Defendant points to Kelly
v. UHC Management Co., 967 F.Supp. 1240, 1258-60
(N.D.Ala.1997), in support of its argument that the
ability to modify or terminate a contract does not
destroy mutuality of obligation. Kelly, 967 F.Supp. at
1258-60 (finding an arbitration agreement to be valid
despite a clause allowing the employer to alter or revoke
at any time). Moreover, Defendant argues that both
Plaintiff and Defendant "made an objective
manifestation of their intent to be bound" to arbitration
of employment-related claims by signing the short but
detailed Agreement in the application form (doc. 3).
Defendant distinguishes its six-page application form
from the sixty-page employee handbook in which the
employer in Trumbull, 12 F.Supp.2d at 687, "buried" its
arbitration clause.
The Court agrees that the facts of this case may be
distinguished from the facts of Trumbull. Both Plaintiff
and Defendant signed the Agreement within the short
job application, and even though Defendant could alter
or terminate the Agreement or the Rules and
Procedures, Defendant could only do so at certain times
and only after providing 30 days' notice to employees.
Accordingly, we find that both parties are bound to the
terms of the Agreement, and thus, mutuality of
obligation exists.
C. Lack of Consideration
For the same reasons asserted above, Plaintiff contends
that the Agreement also lacks consideration. Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant could freely terminate or
modify the Agreement and that, therefore, Defendant
gave up nothing of value in exchange for Plaintiff's
promise to arbitrate. In addition, Plaintiff asserts that,
because she signed the second application form after her
employment began, an accompanying promise by
Defendant to employ her cannot constitute
consideration.
Under Ohio law, "[v]aluable consideration may consist
of either a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the
promisor." Ford v. Tandy Transp., Inc., 86 Ohio App.3d
364, 384, 620 N.E.2d 996, 1009 (1993). Furthermore,
"[i]t is axiomatic that courts, as a general rule, will not
inquire into the adequacy of consideration once
consideration is said to exist." Rogers v. Runfola &
Assoc., Inc., 57 Ohio St.3d 5, 6, 565 N.E.2d 540, 542
(1991).
Defendant argues that the Agreement is supported by
consideration. According to Defendant, Plaintiff was an
at-will employee and Defendant was not required by law
to arbitrate job termination issues related 
[70 F.Supp.2d
824]
 to at-will employees. Therefore, Defendant asserts
that its promise to submit to arbitration constituted
adequate consideration. Moreover, Defendant cites to
the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the
proposition that its ability to alter or terminate the
Agreement does not render the above promise illusory.
See Restatement (2d) of Contracts 
§
 77(b) Cmt. b, illus.
5 (1979) (describing that a principal's ability to
terminate the agency only upon 30 days notice is
consideration); see also Kelly, 967 F.Supp. at 1260.
In Johnson v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 148 F.3d 373, 378
(4th Cir.1998), the Fourth Circuit found that the same
Circuit City arbitration agreement to be supported by
adequate consideration:
[B]oth parties in this case agreed to be bound by the arbitration
process for the resolution of any claim required to be submitted to
arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Agreement. Therefore,
we hold that the Dispute Resolution Agreement was supported by
adequate consideration ... no consideration above and beyond the
agreement to be bound by the arbitration process was required.
Id. at 378; see also O'Neil v. Hilton Head Hosp., 115 F.3d
272, 275 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that a mutual promise
to arbitrate constitutes sufficient consideration for an
arbitration agreement). Likewise, in Michalski v. Circuit
City Stores, Inc., 177 F.3d 634, 636 (7th Cir.1999), the
Seventh Circuit found that "Circuit City's promise to be
bound by the arbitration process itself serves as mutual
consideration here."
This Court finds that the Agreement challenged in the
instant matter is supported by consideration. Plaintiff
promised to arbitrate all employment-related disputes in
exchange for Defendant's promise to consider her for
employment and then to continue to employ her.
Defendant also promised to be bound by the arbitration
process and any resolutions reached as a result of the
arbitration; Defendant could only alter or revoke this
promise under certain circumstances. See Michalski, 177
F.3d at 636-37; Koveleskie v. SBC Capital Mkts., Inc.,
167 F.3d 361, 368 (7th Cir.1999) (finding adequate
consideration in the employer's promise to employ an
applicant who signed an arbitration agreement). Thus,
we reject Plaintiff's argument that the Agreement
cannot be enforced for a lack of consideration.
D. Waiver of Future Rights
Plaintiff further asserts that the Agreement is an invalid
waiver of her prospective rights under both state and
federal law. In support of her argument, Plaintiff cites to
cases in which courts required waivers of prospective
rights to be made knowingly, voluntarily, and
intentionally. See Adams v. Philip Morris, Inc., 67 F.3d
580, 583-84 (6th Cir.1995); Trumbull, 12 F.Supp.2d at
686; Parente v. Day, 16 Ohio App.2d 35, 38, 241 N.E.2d
280, 282 (1968). Plaintiff also quotes from Adams that
the "general rule in [the Sixth Circuit is] that an
employee may not prospectively waive his or her rights
under either Title VII or the ADEA." Id., 67 F.3d at 584.
However, as Defendant indicates, Plaintiff's quotation
from Adams is misleading. In Adams, the Sixth Circuit
addressed an agreement to release a claim entirely and
not to submit the claim to an arbitral forum. Id. at 583-
84. The Supreme Court in Mitsubishi Motors Corp.,
though, found that "a party does not forgo" substantive
rights in signing an arbitration agreement. Id., 473 U.S.
at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346. Instead, the party allows the
rights to be addressed through arbitration. Id.
Moreover, the Sixth Circuit in Willis specifically
recognized that parties could agree to arbitrate future
claims arising under Title VII. Id., 948 F.2d at 310.
Defendant further contends that parties may waive the
right to a jury trial by prior written agreement. K.M.C.
Co., Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., 757 F.2d 752, 755 (6th
Cir.1985); see also Koveleskie, 167 F.3d at 368 (noting
that the right to an Article III forum is waivable and
finding that plaintiff 
[70 F.Supp.2d 825]
 waived that
right by consenting to arbitration). As the court in
K.M.C. Co. noted, any such waivers must be knowing
and voluntary. Id., 757 F.2d at 755. In Trumbull, the
district court found that the plaintiff did not knowingly
or voluntarily waive her rights. Id., 12 F.Supp.2d at 687.
The arbitration clause at issue in Trumbull took up less
than two pages of a sixty-page employee handbook and
gave no indication that it affected the employee's legal
rights. Id. Furthermore, the arbitration clause failed to
specifically explain that it could affect federal or state
law claims. Id.
However, in this case, we initially find that the
Agreement in which Plaintiff and Defendant promised
to submit to final and binding arbitration of any
employment-related claims is clear and unambiguous.
The Agreement, set forth in two pages of a six-page
application form, specifically notes the types of claims
that are subject to arbitration. In bold-faced print, the
language of the Agreement alerted Plaintiff that the
Agreement affected her legal rights and that legal advice
may be warranted. The language also informed her that
Circuit City could ask a court to compel arbitration of
any employment-related claims.
Furthermore, we find that Plaintiff entered into the
Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. First, as we
noted above, the Agreement clearly and unambiguously
explains that it amounts to a waiver of a judicial forum
and a jury trial. Secondly, her background indicates that
she had knowledge of management- and
administration-related issues. According to the
application forms she signed, Plaintiff had earned an
undergraduate degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy
and a master's degree from Central Michigan University
prior to applying for a job with Defendant (see doc. 4,
Parsons Decl., Ex. A). Thirdly, the Agreement indicates
that she could have withdrawn her consent to the
Agreement within three days of signing the application
form, and Plaintiff concedes that she did not withdraw
her consent.
Accordingly, we conclude that the Agreement
represents a knowing and voluntary waiver of Plaintiff's
prospective right to a judicial forum and a jury trial for
her employment-related claims.
E. Process Provided by Agreement
Underpinning many of Plaintiff's arguments is her
allegation that Defendant's Dispute Resolution Rules
and Procedures deny her substantive rights and
remedies. In Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647, the
Supreme Court found that "`so long as the prospective
litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory
cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will
continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent
function.'" Id., 500 U.S. at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (quoting
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.S. at 637, 105 S.Ct.
3346). Essentially, then, Plaintiff contends that
Defendant's arbitration procedures prevent her from
effectively vindicating her cause of action.
Plaintiff again relies on Trumbull, 12 F.Supp.2d at 688,
to support her argument. In reaching its alternative
holding that the arbitration procedure offered by the
defendant was not an acceptable replacement for a
judicial forum, the Trumbull court noted that, unlike
Title VII, the defendant's procedure precluded punitive
damages. The court found that when an arbitration
proceeding limits any substantive right or remedy
granted by a statute, that proceeding cannot effectively
vindicate that statute's cause of action. Id.
Furthermore, Plaintiff refers to Hooters of America, Inc.
v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933, 938-38 (4th Cir.1999), in
which the Fourth Circuit held that an employer
materially breached an arbitration agreement "by
promulgating rules so egregiously unfair as to constitute
a complete default of its contractual obligation to draft
arbitration rules and to do so in good faith." The
arbitration rules set up by Hooters of America, Inc.
("Hooters") essentially allowed the company to
unilaterally select 
[70 F.Supp.2d 826]
 the arbitrator and
control the proceedings. Id. According to the Fourth
Circuit, Hooters' rules were "so one-sided that their only
possible purpose [was] to undermine the neutrality of
the proceeding." Id. at 938.
In the instant matter, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's
Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures also "severely
curtail" Plaintiff's substantive rights and remedies.
Plaintiff points first to Rule 4 and argues that the time
limit for initiating an arbitration proceeding is shorter
than the time granted under Title VII or Ohio Rev.Code
§
 4112 for initiating a judicial proceeding. Rule 4 states:
The "Circuit City Associate Arbitration Request Form" shall be
submitted not later than one year after the date on which the
associate knew, or through reasonable diligence should have
known, of the facts giving rise to the associate's claim(s). The
failure of an associate to initiate an arbitration within the one year
limit shall constitute a waiver with respect to that dispute relative
to that associate.
(doc. 4, Parsons Decl., Ex. B) (emphasis in original).
In contrast, Defendant argues that contractual parties
may shorten statute of limitations. See Myers v.
Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., 849 F.2d 259, 262 (6th
Cir. 1988) (finding "nothing inherently unreasonable
about a six-month limitations period"). Defendant
accordingly argues that the one-year limitation period
provided for in the Agreement is reasonable.
Plaintiff secondly argues that discovery is restrained
since the Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures limit
the number of interrogatories, the number of
depositions, and the overall time for discovery. Under
Rule 8, parties are to initially disclose all non-privileged
documents that the parties believe support their
positions (see doc. 4, Parsons Decl., Ex. B). In addition,
Rule 8 requires:
• Circuit City to supply the employee with documents from the
employee's personnel file;
• One set of interrogatories with a document request;
• Three depositions; and
• Any additional discovery upon a showing of substantial need.
• Discovery to be completed within 90 days with time extended for
good cause.
(Id.).
In response to Plaintiff's limited-discovery argument,
Defendant notes that the Supreme Court allows
reasonable limitations on discovery in arbitration of
statutory discrimination claims. Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 31,
111 S.Ct. 1647. Defendant further contends that the
Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures allow the
parties to engage in meaningful discovery. Because
additional discovery is possible and because the time can
be extended for good cause, Defendant asserts that the
discovery offered under the Dispute Resolution Rules
and Procedures is also fair and reasonable.
Thirdly, Plaintiff contends that the Dispute Resolution
Rules and Procedures limit the remedies and damages
available to Plaintiff. Under Rule 14, an arbitrator is
permitted to award:
• Injunctive relief, including reinstatement to employment;
• Up to one year of back pay and reimbursement for lost fringe
benefits with interest;
• Up to two years of front pay if reinstatement is not practical or
reasonable under the circumstances;
• Compensatory damages;
• Punitive damages equal to the monetary sum of the front pay,
back pay, and benefits awarded, or $5,000, whichever is greater; and
• Reasonable attorney's fees and costs to a prevailing employee
(Id.). Plaintiff argues the limitations on back pay, front
pay, and punitive damages 
[70 F.Supp.2d 827]
contradict the provisions of Title VII and Ohio
Rev.Code 
§
 4112.99.
In contrast, Defendant contends that a limitation on
damages does not alone make an arbitration agreement
unenforceable. See Baravati v. Josephthal, Lyon & Ross,
Inc., 28 F.3d 704, 709 (7th Cir.1994) (finding that
"parties [to an employment arbitration agreement]
surely can stipulate that punitive damages will not be
awarded."); Degaetano v. Smith Barney, Inc., 983
F.Supp. 459, 468-69 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (enforcing an
arbitration agreement generally, but voiding as against
public policy the provision in the agreement precluding
recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees); Farrell v.
Convergent Communications, Inc., No. C98-2613 MJJ,
1998 WL 774626, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17314, at *14
(N.D.Cal. Oct. 29, 1998) (concluding that "limitations on
the amount of damages alone does not render an
agreement to arbitrate per se unconscionable, as parties
are generally free to contract as they see fit").
Moreover, Defendant asserts that the limitations on
back pay, front pay, and punitive damages would not
preclude Plaintiff from recovering a fair and reasonable
amount of damages. Defendant further calculates that
Plaintiff could actually recover a higher award of
damages under the arbitration than Title VII. According
to Defendant, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 limits
Plaintiff to $300,000 in combined compensatory and
punitive damages. Title 42 U.S.C. 
§
 1981a(a)(1) & (b)(3).
On the other hand, the Circuit City arbitration rules,
Defendant argues, would allow Plaintiff to recover up to
$162,000 in punitive damages and unlimited
compensatory damages. Thus, Defendant asserts that
the total recovery for Plaintiff pursuant to an arbitration
award could exceed the statutory minimum.
We note that other courts have approved of the
remedies found in Defendant's arbitration agreement.
See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, No. C98-
0365CAL (N.D.Cal. Apr. 29, 1998) (staying the
proceeding and finding that the limitation on remedies
does not "amount to the extreme one-sidedness that's
required for a finding of unconscionability as a matter of
law"); Ward v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., No. CIV-S-97-
0227 (E.D.Cal. Mar. 29, 1997) (finding that the remedies
available under the Agreement are not unconscionable
because they are sufficiently similar to limits in federal
and state law).
After considering all of the arguments raised by Plaintiff
about the arbitration procedure offered by Defendant,
the Court is not persuaded that the procedure would be
an unacceptable replacement for a judicial forum. To the
contrary, we find that the one-year limitations period
and discovery procedures are fair and reasonable. In
contrast to the rules examined by the Fourth Circuit in
Hooters, 173 F.3d at 938-39, Defendant's Dispute
Resolution Rules and Procedures do not "undermine the
neutrality of the proceeding." Moreover, Plaintiff may
recover both compensatory and punitive damages as
well as reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under the
Agreement. Therefore, we conclude that Plaintiff could
effectively vindicate her statutory and common law
causes of action in the arbitral forum offered by
Defendant.
F. Public Policy
Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the Agreement violates
public policy by taking away her right to a jury trial.
Plaintiff argues that both the U.S. Constitution and the
Ohio Constitution express a public policy in favor of the
right to a jury trial, and so mandatory arbitration
agreements should not be enforced by the courts. In
support of her argument, Plaintiff notes that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), the
National Academy of Arbitrators, and the Taskforce on
Alternative Dispute Resolution in Employment have
concluded that only voluntary and non-binding types of
alternative dispute resolutions should be encouraged in
the workplace. On July 10, 1997, the EEOC stated:
[70 F.Supp.2d 828]
 The use of unilaterally imposed agreements
mandating binding arbitration of employment discrimination
disputes as a condition of employment harms both the individual
civil rights claimant and the public interest in eradicating
discrimination. Those whom the law seeks to regulate should not
be permitted to exempt themselves from federal enforcement of
civil rights laws. Nor should they be permitted to deprive civil
rights claimants of the choice to vindicate their statutory rights in
the courts—an avenue of redress determined by Congress to be
essential to enforcement.
EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 10, 1997), reprinted in
Excerpts from Text: EEOC Rejects Mandatory Binding
Employment Arbitration, 52 Disp. Resol. J. 11, 14
(1997).
Defendant, however, insists that both the Supreme
Court and the Sixth Circuit recognize the value of
arbitration and enforce valid arbitration agreements
regardless of whether these agreements call for
mandatory or voluntary arbitration. In light of the case
law reviewed by this Court, we agree that Congress as
well as federal and state courts generously support
arbitration.
In Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.
Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765,
(1983), the Supreme Court stated that the Federal
Arbitration Act "is a congressional declaration of a
liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements."
See also Asplundh, 71 F.3d at 595 (quoting same). Ohio
courts also "favor and encourage arbitration." See, e.g.,
Weiss v. Voice/Fax Corp., 94 Ohio App.3d 309, 312,
640 N.E.2d 875, 877 (1994); Menardi v. Petrigalla, 11
Ohio App.3d 9, 11, 462 N.E.2d 1246, 1249 (1983)
(quoting Campbell v. Automatic Die & Prod. Co., 162
Ohio St. 321, 329, 123 N.E.2d 401, 405 (1954)).
Moreover, in addition to a constitutionally-recognized
right to a jury trial, Ohio courts hold the "concept of
`freedom of contract' to be fundamental to our society."
Royal Indem. Co. v. Baker Protective Serv., Inc., 33
Ohio App.3d 184, 186, 515 N.E.2d 5, 7 (1986).
Because we conclude that Plaintiff's substantive rights
are protected within the arbitration agreement at issue
in this case, we are unpersuaded by Plaintiff's public
policy argument. As the Supreme Court noted in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.S. at 628, 105 S.Ct.
3346, "[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a
party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by
the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an
arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum." The Supreme
Court did not distinguish between voluntary and
compulsory arbitration. Instead, the Supreme Court
simply indicated that an employee's substantive rights
can be protected outside of a judicial forum and a jury
trial pursuant to a valid and enforceable contract to
arbitrate. In the instant matter, we find the Agreement
to be valid and enforceable, and we believe that Plaintiff
should be held to her promise to arbitrate.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, since the Court holds (1) that this case falls
within the coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act; (2)
that the Agreement is broad enough to cover the
disputes asserted in this case; and (3) that the Agreement
is valid and enforceable, we hereby COMPEL
arbitration of Plaintiff's claims.
As to Defendant's request that this Court stay the
proceedings pending arbitration under 
§
 3 of the FAA
or dismiss this matter pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule
12(b)(6), we note that a court may dismiss a lawsuit
when it determines that all of the issues involved are
subject to arbitration. Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds,
Inc., 975 F.2d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir. 1992); Farrell, No.
C98-2613 MJJ, 1998 WL 774626, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
17314, at *16-*17. After a review of Plaintiff's
Complaint, we find that all of the claims asserted in her
Complaint are employment-related and thereby subject
to the 
[70 F.Supp.2d 829]
 arbitration agreement.
Moreover, the Agreement calls for final and binding
arbitration. Therefore, pursuant to the valid contract
signed between Plaintiff and Defendant, we find that the
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims
asserted in Plaintiff's Complaint and that we may
dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).
Thus, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendant's Motion
to Compel Arbitration and hereby DISMISSES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff's action against
Defendant.
SO ORDERED.
