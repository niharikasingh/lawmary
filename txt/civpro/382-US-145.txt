Respondent, a North Carolina corporation, brought this
action in a North Carolina state court. It sought
$200,000 in damages for defamation alleged to have
occurred during the course of the United Steelworkers'
campaign to unionize respondent's employees. The
Steelworkers, an unincorporated labor union whose
principal place of business purportedly is Pennsylvania,
removed the case to a Federal District Court.
1 
 The
union asserted not only federal-question jurisdiction,
but that for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction it was a
citizen of Pennsylvania, although some of its members
were North Carolinians.
The corporation sought to have the case remanded to
the state courts, contending that its complaint raised no
federal questions and relying upon the generally
prevailing principle that an unincorporated association's
citizenship is that of each of its members. But the
District Court retained jurisdiction. The District Judge
noted "a trend to treat unincorporated associations in
the same manner as corporations and to treat them as
citizens of the state wherein the principal office is
located." Divining "no common sense reason for
treating an unincorporated national labor union
differently from a corporation," he declined to follow
what he styled "the poorer reasoned but more firmly
established rule" of Chapman v. Barney, 129 U.S. 677.
On interlocutory appeal the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit reversed and directed that the case be
remanded 
[382 U.S. 147]
 to the state courts. 336 F.2d
160. Certiorari was granted, 379 U.S. 958, so that we
might decide whether an unincorporated labor union is
to be treated as a citizen for purposes of federal diversity
jurisdiction, without regard to the citizenship of its
members.
2 
 Because we believe this properly a matter for
legislative consideration which cannot adequately or
appropriately be dealt with by this Court, we affirm the
decision of the Court of Appeals.
Article III, 
§
 2, of the Constitution provides:
"The judicial Power shall extend . . . to Controversies. . . between
Citizens of different States . . . ."
Congress lost no time in implementing the grant. In
1789 it provided for federal jurisdiction in suits
"between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought,
and a citizen of another State."
3 
 There shortly arose the
question as to whether a corporation—a creature of state
law—is to be deemed a "citizen" for purposes of the
statute. This Court, through Chief Justice Marshall,
initially responded in the negative, holding that a
corporation was not a "citizen" and that it might sue and
be sued under the diversity statute only if none of its
shareholders was a co-citizen of any opposing party.
[382 U.S. 148]
 Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5
Cranch 61. In 1844 the Court reversed itself and ruled
that a corporation was to be treated as a citizen of the
State which created it. Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v.
Letson, 2 How. 497. Ten years later, the Court reached
the same result by a different approach. In a
compromise destined to endure for over a century,
4 
 the
Court indulged in the fiction that, although a
corporation was not itself a citizen for diversity
purposes, its shareholders would conclusively be
presumed citizens of the incorporating State. Marshall v.
Baltimore & O. R. Co., 16 How. 314.
Congress re-entered the lists in 1875, significantly
expanding diversity jurisdiction by deleting the
requirement imposed in 1789 that one of the parties
must be a citizen of the forum State.
5 
 The resulting
increase in the quantity of diversity litigation, however,
cooled enthusiasts of the jurisdiction, and in 1887 and
1888 Congress enacted sharp curbs. It quadrupled the
jurisdictional amount, confined the right of removal to
nonresident defendants, reinstituted protections against
jurisdiction by collusive assignment, and narrowed
venue.
6
[382 U.S. 149]
 It was in this climate that the Court in
1889 decided Chapman v. Barney, supra. On its own
motion the Court observed that plaintiff was a joint
stock company and not a corporation or natural person.
It held that although plaintiff was endowed by New
York with capacity to sue, it could not be considered a
"citizen" for diversity purposes. 129 U. S., at 682.7
In recent years courts and commentators have reflected
dissatisfaction with the rule of Chapman v. Barney.
8
The distinction between the "personality" and
"citizenship" of corporations and that of labor unions
and other unincorporated associations, it is increasingly
argued, has become artificial and unreal. The mere fact
that a corporation is endowed with a birth certificate is,
they say, of no consequence. In truth and in fact, they
point out, many voluntary associations and labor unions
are indistinguishable from corporations in terms of the
reality 
[382 U.S. 150]
 of function and structure, and to
say that the latter are juridical persons and "citizens" and
the former are not is to base a distinction upon an
inadequate and irrelevant difference. They assert, with
considerable merit, that it is not good judicial
administration, nor is it fair, to remit a labor union or
other unincorporated association to vagaries of
jurisdiction determined by the citizenship of its
members and to disregard the fact that unions and
associations may exist and have an identity and a local
habitation of their own.
The force of these arguments in relation to the diversity
jurisdiction is particularized by petitioner's showing in
this case. Petitioner argues that one of the purposes
underlying the jurisdiction—protection of the
nonresident litigant from local prejudice—is especially
applicable to the modern labor union. According to the
argument, when the nonresident defendant is a major
union, local juries may be tempted to favor local
interests at its expense. Juries may also be influenced by
the fear that unionization would adversely affect the
economy of the community and its customs and
practices in the field of race relations. In support of these
contentions, petitioner has exhibited material showing
that during organizational campaigns like that involved
in this case, localities have been saturated with
propaganda concerning such economic and racial fears.
Extending diversity jurisdiction to unions, says
petitioner, would make available the advantages of
federal procedure, Article III judges less exposed to local
pressures than their state court counterparts, juries
selected from wider geographical areas, review in
appellate courts reflecting a multi-state perspective, and
more effective review by this Court.
We are of the view that these arguments, however
appealing, are addressed to an inappropriate forum, and
that pleas for extension of the diversity jurisdiction to
[382 U.S. 151]
 hitherto uncovered broad categories of
litigants ought to be made to the Congress and not to
the courts.
Petitioner urges that in Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co.,
288 U.S. 476, we have heretofore breached the doctrinal
wall of Chapman v. Barney and, that step having been
taken, there is now no necessity for enlisting the
assistance of Congress. But Russell does not furnish the
precedent which petitioner seeks. The problem which it
presented was that of fitting an exotic creation of the
civil law, the sociedad en comandita, into a federal
scheme which knew it not. The Organic Act of Puerto
Rico conferred jurisdiction upon the federal court if all
the parties on either side of a controversy were citizens
of a foreign state or "citizens of a State, Territory or
District of the United States not domiciled in Puerto
Rico."
9 
 All of the sociedad's members were nonresidents
of Puerto Rico, and jurisdiction lay in the federal court if
they were the "parties" to the action. But this Court held
that the sociedad itself, not its members, was the party,
doing so on a basis that is of no help to petitioner. It did
so because, as Justice Stone stated for the Court, in
"[t]he tradition of the civil law, as expressed in the Code
of Puerto Rico," "the sociedad is consistently regarded as
a juridical person." 288 U. S., at 480-481. Accordingly,
the Court held that the sociedad, Russell & Co., was a
citizen domiciled in Puerto Rico, within the meaning of
the Organic Act, and ordered the case remanded to the
insular courts. It should be noted that 
[382 U.S. 152]
 the
effect of Russell was to contract jurisdiction of the
federal court in Puerto Rico.
10
If we were to accept petitioner's urgent invitation to
amend diversity jurisdiction so as to accommodate its
case, we would be faced with difficulties which we could
not adequately resolve. Even if the record here were
adequate, we might well hesitate to assume that
petitioner's situation is sufficiently representative or
typical to form the predicate of a general principle. We
should, for example, be obliged to fashion a test for
ascertaining of which State the labor union is a citizen.
Extending the jurisdiction to corporations raised no
such problem, for the State of incorporation was a
natural candidate, its arguable irrelevance in terms of
the policies underlying the jurisdiction being
outweighed by its certainty of application. But even that
easy and apparent solution did not dispose of the
problem; in 1958 Congress thought it necessary to enact
legislation providing that corporations are citizens both
of the State of incorporation and of the State in which
their principal place of business is located.
11 
 Further, in
contemplating a rule which would accommodate
petitioner's claim, we are acutely aware of the
complications arising from the circumstance that
petitioner, like other labor unions, has local as well as
national organizations and that these, 
[382 U.S. 153]
perhaps, should be reckoned with in connection with
"citizenship" and its jurisdictional incidents.
12
Whether unincorporated labor unions ought to be
assimilated to the status of corporations for diversity
purposes, how such citizenship is to be determined, and
what if any related rules ought to apply, are decisions
which we believe suited to the legislative and not the
judicial branch, regardless of our views as to the
intrinsic merits of petitioner's argument—merits stoutly
attested by widespread support for the recognition of
labor unions as juridical personalities.

We affirm the decision below.
