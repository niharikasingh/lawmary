I join the Court's opinion in full because I understand
the discussion in Part II—B not to foreclose the
possibility that the "in relation to" language of 18 U. S.
C. § 924(c)(1) requires more than mere furtherance or
facilitation of a crime of violence or drug-trafficking
crime. I agree with the Court that because petitioner's
use of his MAC-10 meets any reasonable construction of
the phrase, it is unnecessary to determine in this case the
precise contours of "in relation to" as it appears in §
924(c)(1). See ante, at 238.
