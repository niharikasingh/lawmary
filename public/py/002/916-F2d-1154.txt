Would a company whose customer paid 50.1% of the
bill think it had received "substantially all" of the price?
Not likely. Nonetheless, Continental Can Company
insists that when a majority of a pension fund's assets
come from firms engaged in the trucking business,
contributing employers qualify for a treatment that is
available only if "substantially all of the contributions
required under the plan are made by employers
primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking
industry", 29 U.S.C. § 1383(d)(2).
When Continental Can employed truck drivers to
transport some of its goods in the Chicago area it made
pension contributions to the Chicago Truck Drivers
Pension Fund. Continental closed its trucking operation
in July 1985 and withdrew from the Pension Fund,
which demanded that it make good its share of the
Fund's under-fundedness — as it must, 29 U.S.C. §§
1381, 1391, unless "substantially all" of the Fund's assets
come from "employers primarily engaged in the long
and short haul trucking industry". An arbitrator
determined that 61.6% of the Fund's assets are
attributable to such employers and that "substantially
all" means 85%; he ordered Continental to make
withdrawal payments exceeding $700,000. Continental
asked the district court to set this award aside; the court
enforced the award, 1989 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 13997
(N.D.Ill.), concluding (in line with several other courts)
that less than 85% cannot be "substantially all". Republic
Industries, Inc. v. Teamsters Joint Council, 718 F.2d
628, 643 n. 19 (4th Cir.1983) (dictum); Central States
Pension Fund v. Bellmont Trucking Co., 610 F.Supp.
1505 (N.D.Ind.1985), affirmed on other grounds, 788
F.2d 428 (7th Cir.1986); Peick v. PBGC, 539 F.Supp.
1025, 1060 (N.D.Ill.1982), affirmed on other grounds,
724 F.2d 1247 (7th Cir.1983).
"Substantially all" sounds like "less than all, but not
much less". Arbitrators and courts must convert this
phrase to a percentage in order to make it work, which
raises the question why Congress did not enact a
percentage in the first place. It is as easy to write "a
majority" or "two thirds" or "three quarters" or 85% or
e-0.162 as it is to write "substantially all" — and any of
the former choices would have prevented disputes of
this kind. Perhaps, however, "substantially all" is an
attractive [916 F.2d 1156] standard because it enables
Members of Congress to say different things to different
interest groups. The genesis of § 1383(d)(2), which was
§ 4203(d)(2) of the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980, suggests something of this
kind — although it is also consistent with the possibility
that the sponsor pulled the wrong language out of his
pocket.
On May 22, 1980, the House unanimously passed H.R.
3904, its bill to establish a system of withdrawal liability
for under-funded pension plans. This bill lacked an
exclusion for the trucking industry. Many of that
industry's plans are chronically under-funded. The
business also is characterized by frequent entry and exit
(many firms are small). Exit does not necessarily
threaten pension plans, because when one firm leaves
another picks up the slack. Continental's departure had
exactly this effect: although Continental closed its
trucking operations, it still needs to move its goods.
When the Senate's Labor and Human Resources and
Finance Committees reported the Senate equivalent of
H.R. 3904 to the floor on July 24, 1980, the bill had a
special rule for the trucking business, in exactly the
language that became § 4203(d)(2). The report
accompanying the bill did not discuss the meaning of
"substantially all".
The House accepted most of the Senate's amendments to
H.R. 3904. Representative Thompson, the floor
manager, commented on this particular change:
The [Senate] bill also contains a special withdrawal liability rule for
certain trucking industry plans where substantially all of the
contributions are made by employers primarily engaged in the long
and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving
industry or the public warehousing industry. The phrase
"substantially all" appears in several provisions of the tax laws —
including the industrial development bond and the private
foundation rules — where the Internal Revenue Service has
interpreted the phrase to mean at least 85 percent. It is our intent
that, as used in this special trucking industry withdrawal liability
rule, the substantially all requirement would only be satisfied where
at least 85 percent of the contributions to the plan are made by
employers who are primarily engaged in the specified industries.
126 Cong.Rec. 23040 (Aug. 25, 1980). The House passed
the legislation unanimously the same day.
One day later the Senate also passed H.R. 3904, making
a few changes in the House's latest version, amendments
irrelevant to § 4203(d)(2) — which the House accepted
verbatim. In a text sandwiched between two "speeches"
marked by a • (indicating that the remarks were inserted
after the debate rather than delivered on the floor) Sen.
Durenberger explained why special treatment for the
trucking industry is appropriate and added:
[I]t should be observed that if the majority of the contributions to
any pension plan are made by employers engaged in over the road
(long) and short haul trucking ... this withdrawal liability procedure
will apply to all employers who contribute to such a plan.
126 Cong.Rec. 23286-87 (Aug. 26, 1980). This remark,
coming after both House and Senate had agreed to the
language of § 4203(d)(2), is the first time anyone
implied that "substantially all" means "majority".
Because the House was unwilling to accept all of the
Senate's further amendments, the chambers held a
conference. Section 4203(d)(2), language common to the
two versions, was not mentioned in the Conference
Committee's report. On September 26, 1980, President
Carter signed the bill into law. That was not, however,
the end of Senator Durenberger's efforts to explain his
amendment. On November 19, 1980, the Senator
inserted into the Congressional Record still another
bulleted statement:
Recently ... I found out that on the very day that I clarified the
intent of this special withdrawal liability procedure for the trucking
industry, Mr. Thompson told the House of Representatives that
this special rule would only apply if at least [916 F.2d 1157] 85
percent of the contributions to the plan were made by employers
previously engaged in the specified industries. Mr. Thompson
based his statement upon unrelated interpretations of the phrase
"substantially all."
Since this amendment originated in the Senate without Mr.
Thompson's participation, I am amazed that he would undertake an
interpretation of the intent of the language.
My interpretation was based on information supplied to me as to
the diversity of Teamster representation, and I am convinced that
an 85-percent contribution requirement would emasculate the
special withdrawal procedure.
Therefore, as a final clarification, I will reiterate that the
withdrawal liability procedure will apply to any multiemployer
pension plan in the trucking industry if the majority (50.1 percent)
of contributions to the plan are made by employers who are
primarily engaged in the long- and short-haul trucking industry,
the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing
industry. •
126 Cong.Rec. 30203 (Nov. 19, 1980). Representative
Thompson did not file a surrebuttal, perhaps thinking
that the race is to the swift — for he had gotten his
thoughts into the record before the House voted, while
Senator Durenberger's two statements came after the
Senate first adopted § 4203(d)(2), and the Senator's
second statement came nearly two months after the bill
became law.
Although Senator Durenberger was "amazed" that
anyone would dare to interpret language he had not
written, we do not view Representative Thompson's
speech as an exercise in temerity. The Senate amended
H.R. 3904 and wanted the House to accept its revisions.
Members of the House were entitled to form their own
understanding of the language before deciding whether
to enact it. Words do not have meanings given by
natural law. You don't have to be Ludwig Wittgenstein
or Hans-Georg Gadamer to know that successful
communication depends on meanings shared by
interpretive communities. See In re Erickson, 815 F.2d
1090 (7th Cir.1987). Texts are addressed to readers, in
this case initially to the Representatives. Authors'
private meanings — meanings subjectively held but not
communicated — do not influence the readers' beliefs.
The Senate, and then the House, and the Senate once
again, passed § 4203(d)(2) without knowing Senator
Durenberger's belief that "substantially all" means 50.1%.
At the time the President signed the bill, Rep.
Thompson's specific statement of August 25 and Sen.
Durenberger's vague one of August 26 were the only
ones on paper. Representative Thompson's was in line
with a frequent meaning of the phrase and must have
supplied the meaning for the bulk of Members and the
President, if the phrase was ever present to their minds.
That is why statements after enactment do not count;
the legislative history of a bill is valuable only to the
extent it shows genesis and evolution, making
"subsequent legislative history" an oxymoron. Pierce v.
Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 566-68, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550,
101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); Regional Rail Reorganization
Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 132, 95 S.Ct. 335, 353, 42
L.Ed.2d 320 (1974); United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d
1312, 1318 (7th Cir.1990) (in banc); Covalt v. Carey
Canada Inc., 860 F.2d 1434, 1438-39 (7th Cir.1988).
Continental Can presses on us an extreme version of the
belief that the "real" law lies in the "intent" of Congress,
of which the words of the statute are just evidence. It is
an extreme version because here the only intent is the
author's; Continental Can wants us to disregard the
intent of all the other Members of Congress and the
President, even though their assent was necessary to put
Sen. Durenberger's text into force. But we need not
worry about whether the argument is modest or
extreme, because its premise is wrong. The text of the
statute, and not the private intent of the legislators, is
the law. Only the text survived the complex process for
proposing, amending, adopting, and obtaining the
President's signature (or two-thirds of each house). It is
easy to announce intents and hard to enact laws; the
Constitution gives force only to what is enacted. [916
F.2d 1158] So the text is law and legislative intent a clue
to the meaning of the text, rather than the text being a
clue to legislative intent. In re Sinclair, 870 F.2d 1340
(7th Cir.1989).
"Substantially all" may have a special meaning. Statutes
contain words of art, whose meaning may appear
strange to a lay reader. Country Mutual Insurance Co. v.
American Farm Bureau Federation, 876 F.2d 599 (7th
Cir.1989). Cf. Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 96 S.Ct. 243,
46 L.Ed.2d 185 (1975). "Substantially all" is one of those
phrases with a special legal meaning. Congress uses it all
the time in tax statutes, and the Internal Revenue
Service decodes it as meaning 85%. Here are a few
examples, well short of "substantially all": (1) 26 U.S.C. §
4071 imposes a tax on tires used for highway vehicles,
unless the vehicles will be used "substantially all" of the
time as school busses, 26 U.S.C. § 4221(e)(3); 26 C.F.R.
§ 48.4221-11(b)(3) provides that "substantially all" in §
4221(d)(7)(C) means 85% or more; (2) 26 U.S.C. §
4942(a) imposes a tax on a charitable foundation's
undistributed income, but 26 U.S.C. § 4942(a)(1) and
(j)(3)(A) exempt foundations that distribute
"substantially all" of their income; 26 C.F.R. §
53.4942(b)-1(c) defines "substantially all" as "85 percent
or more"; (3) 26 U.S.C. § 951(a) imposes a tax on
Americans holding shares of certain foreign
corporations but excludes from the corporations'
income gains from the sale of commodities if
"substantially all" of its business is as an active producer,
§ 954(c)(1)(C)(ii); 26 C.F.R. § 1.954-2T(f)(3)(iv) defines
"substantially all" as "85 percent of the taxable income of
the controlled foreign corporation." There are many
more. All of the regulations we could find, not just
substantially all, quantify this phrase as 85% or more.
The only departure from 85% was on the high side.
Rev.Proc. 77-37, § 3.01, 1977-2 C.B. 568, provides that
the Internal Revenue Service will not issue letter rulings
finding that corporate reorganizations satisfy the
"substantially all" requirements in, e.g., 26 U.S.C. §§
354(b)(1)(A) and 368(a), unless the transferred assets
represent at least 90% of the fair market value of the net
assets.
Because language is an exercise in shared understanding,
one Senator's idiosyncratic meaning does not count.
This was the point of the exchange between Alice and
Humpty Dumpty. If everyone accepts a new meaning
for a word, then the language has changed; if one
speaker chooses a private meaning, we have babble
rather than communication.
The question, then, is whether anyone other than
Senator Durenberger used "substantially all" to signify
50.1% rather than 85%. Nothing in the debates suggests
that they did. Representative Thompson's statement, the
only one delivered on the floor in advance of passage,
shows that he at least (and likely the House) used the
phrase in the customary way. Senator Durenberger's
two comments, inserted in the Congressional Record
after the fact, could not have influenced anyone in the
House and probably did not come to the attention of
anyone in the Senate; anyway it was too late. Efforts of
this kind to change the meaning of a text without
bothering to change the text itself demonstrate why the
use of legislative history has come under such vigorous
attack, even by former Senators. E.g., Electrical
Workers v. NLRB, 814 F.2d 697, 715-20 (D.C.Cir.1987)
(Buckley, J., concurring). See also, e.g., Iron Workers
Pension Trust v. Allied Products Corp., 872 F.2d 208,
213 (7th Cir.1989). If Senator Durenberger wanted to
see whether his colleagues would agree to an
amendment exempting funds the majority of which
came from the trucking industry, he had only to propose
words such as "majority" or "50.1%" or "more than half"
or "most". Instead he chose a formula with a known
meaning and tipped into the Congressional Record a
novel interpretation. Perhaps he believed that language
expressly using a preponderance-of-the-assets standard
would not have been enacted but he expected the federal
courts to accept the legislative "history". Perhaps instead
he meant to propose an amendment saying "majority"
but slipped, and did the best he could later on to convey
what he had meant to propose. Either way, what
Congress [916 F.2d 1159] enacted, as opposed to what
Sen. Durenberger wishes it had enacted, means 85%.
Continental Can has one last hope. Pointing to Sen.
Durenberger's warning that an 85% threshold would
"emasculate the special withdrawal procedure", it asks us
to interpret the exception so that it has some effect. A
study prepared by the Comptroller General bears out
Sen. Durenberger's concern; it concludes that the 85%
threshold
has in effect negated the trucking rule at most trucking plans. Of
the nine trucking plans in our sample, only one has determined that
85 percent of its contributing employers are in the trucking
industry. This plan ... is also relatively small, with fewer than 400
participants and 15 contributing employers.
Assessment of Special Rules Exempting Employers
Withdrawing from Multiemployer Pension Plans from
Withdrawal Liability 25 (1984). Congress does not
legislate in vain, Continental Can reminds us, and it
concludes that we must therefore choose a figure under
85% — preferably under 62%. To this the Fund replies
that § 4203(d)(2) is a mere exception, that the
multiemployer amendments are remedial legislation to
be liberally construed, and that if we emasculate the
exception we will be doing just what Congress wanted.
Debating whether to give liberal or stingy
interpretations to exceptions is a bootless exercise.
"Exceptions" are artifacts of language. If English
contained a word (say, "pepti") meaning "multiemployer
pension plans other than those to which firms
in the trucking industry make 85% of the contributions",
Congress could have said: "Any employer withdrawing
from an under-funded pepti must make up its share of
the shortfall." We would not see this as an "exception";
it would be a rule made intricate by the complex term
"pepti". English does not contain many such
comprehensive words, so statutes are written using
rules and exceptions. Necessary adaptations to the
language should not cause us to read rules broadly, or
narrowly, or somewhere in between. We must instead
ascertain the meaning of the full law as best we can,
without a thumb on the scales.
Whether to shade the meaning of a term in order to
achieve a particular effect (such as "more coverage of the
exemption") also is not a question to which there is a
general answer. Continental Can tells us that Congress'
purpose was exclusion in the trucking industry and it
wants more of this; the Fund tells us that Congress'
purpose was imposition of withdrawal liability for
under-funded plans, and it wants more of that. Of
course Congress' purpose was both of these things, to a
degree, and the question is: what degree? We cannot
divine the balance between objectives by pointing to
their existence. "[N]o legislation pursues its purposes at
all costs. Deciding what competing values will or will
not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular
objective is the very essence of legislative choice — and
it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent
simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the
statute's primary objective must be the law." Rodriguez
v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, 525-26, 107 S.Ct. 1391,
1393, 94 L.Ed.2d 533 (1987) (emphasis in original);
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., ___ U.S.
___, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 2676, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990). See
also Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial Corp.,
474 U.S. 361, 374, 106 S.Ct. 681, 689, 88 L.Ed.2d 691
(1986).
Congress had a choice: it could legislate a means, or it
could legislate a result. It could say that firms
participating in pension plans that have such-and-such
attributes are exempt from withdrawal liability, or it
could say, for example, that the 50% of the pension plans
having the largest share of contributions from the
trucking industry are exempt. It chose the former
method. It (at least Sen. Durenberger and the interest
groups for which he spoke) might have anticipated that
the rule would exempt a large fraction of the industry,
but anticipations and goals are not themselves law. See
Premier Electrical Construction Co. v. National
Electrical Contractors Ass'n, Inc., 814 F.2d 358, 364-65
(7th Cir.1987). Statutory rules frequently differ from the
goals animating their promoters. [916 F.2d 1160]
Prussner v. CIR, 896 F.2d 218, 226 (7th Cir.1990) (in
banc); Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n v. ICC, 894 F.2d
915, 918 (7th Cir.1990).
To see this, suppose that Congress had created an
exclusion if "85% of the contributions required under
the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in
the long and short haul trucking industry", and the
committee reports contained a prediction that this
would exclude two-thirds of the industry. Now suppose
the prediction is wrong, that only 10% of the plans in
the trucking industry get more than 85% of their
contributions from truckers, and a withdrawing firm
convincingly demonstrates that the only way to exclude
2/3 of the plans is to reduce the threshold from 85% to
60%. Would it follow that a plan with 62% of its assets
from the trucking business is exempt? Certainly not.
Congress enacted the percentage and not the
expectation. Disappointment with the results may
supply a good reason for Congress to change the law; it
does not provide a reason for a court to change the law.
From what we can see, the reason § 4203(d)(2) fails to
cover many plans — the parties tell us that with an 85%
threshold it would apply to none of the large plans —
lies principally in another feature of the law.
Contributions count toward the 85% (or the 50.1%) only
if the employer is "primarily engaged" in the trucking
business. Many firms employing truck drivers, and
making large volumes of contributions to the multiemployer
plans in the trucking industry, are not
"primarily engaged" in transportation. Continental Can
is an example. Its contributions to this plan were on
behalf of truck drivers, but none counted toward the
85%. If § 4203(d)(2) applied when "substantially all of
the contributions required under the plan are made [on
behalf of employees] primarily engaged in the long and
short haul trucking industry" (altered language in
brackets), then the Chicago Truck Drivers Pension
Fund would qualify for the exception, as would many
other plans. All of this just goes to show, however, that
if you choose different language, you get a different
result. The language Congress chose excludes the
Chicago Truck Drivers Pension Fund.
AFFIRMED.
