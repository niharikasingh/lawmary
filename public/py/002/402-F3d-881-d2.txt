The question presented in this case is whether an
assignee of an accrued cause of action for copyright
infringement, who has no legal or beneficial interest in
the copyright itself, has standing to sue for copyright
infringement. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. ("Sony")
appeals the district court's order denying its motion to
dismiss Nancey Silvers's ("Silvers") claim for copyright
infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501(b) for lack of
standing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). After rehearing en
banc, the Majority now holds such assignees do not have
standing to sue for copyright infringement and reverses
the district court's order denying Sony's motion to
dismiss.
I believe that the text, purpose and history of the 1976
Copyright Act ("1976 Act") allow such assignees of an
accrued copyright claim to sue for infringement.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
[402 F.3d 896] I.
I quite agree with the Majority that the starting point in
this case is necessarily the statute under which Silvers
brought suit. See op. at 884. Section 501(b) of the 1976
Act provides, in pertinent part:
The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a
copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411,1 to
institute an action for any infringement of that particular right
committed while he or she is the owner of it.
17 U.S.C. § 501(b) (1976).
Turning to first principles, then, it is well-established
that courts should interpret a statute according to its
plain meaning. See United States v. Robinson, 94 F.3d
1325, 1328 (9th Cir.1996) ("If the language of a statute is
unambiguous, the plain meaning controls."). However,
where a statute is ambiguous, courts should consult a
statute's legislative history to discern Congressional
intent. See United States v. Daas, 198 F.3d 1167, 1174
(9th Cir.1999). Here, as the Majority acknowledges, the
statute does not address the present question and is
therefore ambiguous.2 See op. at 885-86 ("[w]e
recognize that [Section 501(b)'s] omission explicitly to
address the present question may create an ambiguity.").
The key to understanding the legislative history of the
1976 Act, then, is an understanding of the history of
standing to sue under copyright law as it existed prior to
the 1976 Act. When read in context with copyright law
that existed before the 1976 Act, and the portions of the
law that were not changed by such Act, a conclusion
different from the Majority's reading emerges.
A. History of the 1909 Copyright Act
Under the Copyright Act of 1909 ("1909 Act")
(codifying copyright law before the enactment of the
1976 Act), the "proprietor" of a copyright was afforded
the right to sue for copyright infringement.3 17 U.S.C. §
101(b) (1909). While the 1909 Act did not define the
term "proprietor," courts interpreted that term to mean
the "sole owner" of the copyright. See, e.g., Gardner v.
Nike, Inc., 279 F.3d 774, 777-778 (9th Cir.2002)
(discussing the general history of the 1909 Act and
holding that a sublicensee of a copyright lacked standing
to sue under the 1976 Act).
The 1909 Act was predicated on the "doctrine of
indivisibility." Id. at 778. That is, under the Act, a
copyright owner possessed an indivisible "bundle of
rights" which were "incapable of assignment in part." Id.
Accordingly, assignment under the 1909 Act included
"the totality of rights commanded by copyright." Id. [402
F.3d 897] Transfer of "[a]nything less than an
assignment was considered a license." Id. Regardless the
particular use of the copyright, "only the copyright
proprietor (which would include an assignee but not a
licensee) had standing to bring an infringement action."
Id. (emphasis added).
Even though the statute granted standing solely to the
"proprietor" of the entire copyright, courts nevertheless
allowed assignees of an accrued cause of action for
copyright infringement to sue for infringement of their
property rights.4 See Prather v. Neva Paperbacks, Inc.,
410 F.2d 698, 700 (5th Cir.1969) (assignee of accrued
cause of action had standing to sue for copyright
infringement); see also Moran v. London Records, Ltd.,
827 F.2d 180, 183 (7th Cir.1987) (noting that courts
applying the 1909 Act held that assignees had standing
to sue for copyright infringement). The infringement
claim, like any other contingent asset,5 could be sold,
much like the copyright holder's claim against a trade
debtor or a coupon clipped from the copyright holder's
bond portfolio.
Moreover, all defenses against the assignor were valid
against the assignee, who "stood in the shoes" of the
assignor. See T.B. Harms & Francis, Day & Hunter v.
Stern, 231 F. 645, 647 (2d Cir.1916) (holding that
plaintiffs, as assignees of composer's rights under the
contract, "stand in [the] shoes" of the assignor and could
assert the defense of lack of mutuality of contract). See
also 17 U.S.C. § 201(d)(2) (1976) ("[t]he owner of any
particular exclusive right is entitled, to the extent of that
right, to all the protection and remedies accorded to the
copyright owner.").
B. History of the 1976 Copyright Act
The 1976 Act was the result of 15 years of debate on
proposed legislation and was precipitated by Congress's
recognition that the nature of copyrighted works had
changed. Congress noted that, during the half-century
since the passage of the 1909 Act, "a wide range of new
techniques for capturing and communicating printed
matter, visual images, and recorded sounds have come
into use." H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 at 159, reprinted in
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659 at 5775. For example, no longer
was an opera performed only in a theater, but such a
work could be performed in movies, television, videos,
records, and other forms. Such technical advances
"generated new industries and new methods for the
production and dissemination of copyrighted works,
and the business relations between authors and users
have evolved new patterns." Id.
Toward that end, Congress recognized the commercial
need to divide and "infinitely subdivide" copyright uses
in recognition of increasing technologically driven
varieties of means of reproduction and distribution.
Thus, one main purpose of the 1976 Act was, for the
first time, to recognize the principle of "divisibility" of
uses of a copyright, and the ability to convey the rights
to uses separately to various reproducers, which
divisible rights did not exist under the 1909 Act. See
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 at 159, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659 at 5775, infra.
[402 F.3d 898] Congress further recognized that
allowing for "divisibility" of the copyright required a
mechanism whereby heretofore barred owners of
exclusive licenses could now sue for copyright
infringement. Accordingly, Congress enacted Section
501 of the 1976 Act to provide access to the courts for
the owner of one or more rights to exclusive use, but did
not mention the right of the owner of the overall
copyright to sue. See 17 U.S.C. § 501(b).
Indeed, in providing for the right of exclusive licensees
to sue, the drafters of the 1976 Act stated:
The principle of the divisibility of copyright ownership, established
by section 201(d), carries with it the need in infringement actions to
safeguard the rights of all copyright owners and to avoid a
multiplicity of suits. Subsection (b) of section 501 enables the
owner of a particular right to bring an infringement action in that
owner's name alone, while at the same time insuring to the extent
possible that the other owners whose rights may be affected are
notified and given a chance to join the action.
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 at 159, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659 at 5775 (emphasis added).6
Far from "suggest[ing] strongly that Congress intended
to limit the class of persons who may sue for
infringement," op. at 886 (emphasis added), the
statement above in italics — and omitted from the
Majority Opinion — demonstrates that Congress
intended to enlarge the ability to bring suit to the
owners of exclusive rights.7
Read in context with provisions of the 1909 Act (to the
extent the acts are not inconsistent), and contrary to the
Majority's conclusion, the 1976 Act's Section 501(b) was
an enlargement of infringement action rights.
Henceforth, standing was not limited only to the
"proprietor"8 of the original copyright; a legal or
beneficial owner of exclusive rights severed by
assignment from the original copyright also had
standing to sue for infringement. However, nothing in
the 1976 Act eliminated [402 F.3d 899] the rights of
copyright owners under Section 101 of the 1909 Act to
their remedies, nor the right of property owners to
enjoy the property rights granted by the statute,
including the assignment and enforcement of accrued
causes of action.
That, I believe, is the way — and the only way — to read
Section 501(b).
II.
The Majority concludes that because the statute does
not expressly grant standing to assignees of an accrued
cause of action, such persons do not have standing. See
op. at 885-86. Rather, the Majority reasons that,
applying the maxim of statutory construction expressio
unius exclusio alterius est, "Congress' explicit listing of
who may sue for copyright infringement should be
understood as an exclusion of others from suing for
infringement." Op. at 885 (emphasis in original). In my
view, the Majority misapplies this maxim of statutory
construction.
First, such maxims of statutory construction are to be
used only when Congressional intent cannot be
discerned. Indeed, we have noted:
Most strongly put, the expressio unius, or inclusiounius, principle is
that `[w]hen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode,
it includes a negative of any other mode.' This is a rule of
interpretation, not a rule of law. The maxim is `a product of logic
and common sense,' properly applied only when it makes sense as a
matter of legislative purpose.... [T]he expressio unius principle
describes what we usually mean by a particular manner of
expression, but does not prescribe how we must interpret a phrase
once written. Understood as a descriptive generalization about
language rather than a prescriptive rule of construction, the maxim
usefully describes a common syntactical implication. `My children
are Jonathan, Rebecca and Seth' means `none of my children are
Samuel.' Sometimes there is no negative pregnant: `get milk, bread,
peanut butter and eggs at the grocery' probably does not mean `do
not get ice cream.'"
Longview Fibre Co. v. Rasmussen, 980 F.2d 1307, 1313
(9th Cir.1992) (internal citations omitted). See also Nat'l
R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat'l Ass'n of R.R. Passengers,
414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974)
("This principle of statutory construction reflects an
ancient maxim — expressio unius est exclusion alterius
... But even the most basic general principles of statutory
construction must yield to clear contrary evidence of
legislative intent."). Here, Congressional intent is readily
discernible, and, as demonstrated above, contrary to the
Majority's application of the maxim.
Second, commentators have noted that the use of
maxims of statutory construction such as "expressio
unius" are problematic insofar as there is no hierarchy of
maxims of statutory interpretation. Why choose
expressio unius rather than another maxim, indeed, the
exact opposite: that listing some cases may include
others? (see fn. 9, infra). In his recent book, A Matter of
Interpretation, Justice Scalia wrote, "[t]he hard truth of
the matter is that American courts have no intelligible,
generally accepted, and consistently applied theory of
statutory interpretation."9 Antonin [402 F.3d 900]
Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation, 14 (1997) (quoting
Henry M. Hart, Jr. & Albert M. Sacks, The Legal Process
1169 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Philip P. Frickey eds.,
1994)).
Third, while maxims of statutory construction may,
indeed, be helpful in interpreting statutes, they are not
binding. The Founders, including Alexander Hamilton,
recognized as much. See Alexander Hamilton, The
Federalist Papers, No. 83 at 464 (Clinton Rossiter ed.,
1961) ("The rules of legal interpretation are rules of
common sense, adopted by the courts in the
construction of laws. The true test of a just application
of them is its conformity with the source from which
they are derived.").
Hence, rather than be guided by a Latin maxim nowhere
mentioned by the 1976 Act or our jurisprudence as
hierarchically preferable to other means of statutory
interpretation, we should be guided by plain legislative
intent, which, as our Supreme Court reminds us, trumps
the ancient Latin maxim underpinning the Majority
Opinion's conclusion. See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.,
414 U.S. at 459, 94 S.Ct. 690.
Indeed, it should be noted that where Congress chooses
to expressly prohibit assignment, it knows how to do so
explicitly. See, e.g., Federal Anti-Assignment Act of
1862, 41 U.S.C. § 15 (expressly prohibiting public
contract claims against the U.S. government from being
assigned); Federal Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, 31
U.S.C. § 3727 (expressly prohibiting assignment of
federal claims against the U.S. government from being
assigned); Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 ("ERISA"), 29 U.S.C. § 1056 (expressly prohibiting
the assignment of pension benefits). Here, that Congress
did not prohibit assignment of infringement claims may
well carry a negative pregnant that it intended not to
prohibit assignment.
A second consideration in statutory interpretation is
practicality, or put another way, the avoidance of an
absurd result. See Royal Foods Co., Inc. v. RJR Holdings
Inc., 252 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir.2001) (courts will not
interpret a statute in a way that results in an absurd or
unreasonable result). Here, were the statute to be read
literally, it would result in absurd or unreasonable
results.
It has long been recognized that assignment of the
copyright does not automatically include assignment of
accrued causes of action for earlier infringements of the
copyright. See Prather, 410 F.2d at 700 ("`a mere
assignment of a copyright does not itself transfer to the
assignee any cause of action for infringements that
occurred prior to the assignment. Unless the assignment
of copyright contains language explicitly transferring
causes of action for prior infringements, the assignee
cannot maintain a suit for infringements which
happened before the effective date of the assignment.'")
(internal citations omitted). See also DeSilva
Construction Corp. v. Herrald, 213 F.Supp. 184, 192
(M.D.Fla.1962) (holding that the assignment of
copyright under 1909 Act does not include the right to
sue for "infringements antedating the assignment" and
since the assignment as written failed to contain such a
grant, "no such right is conferred by the assignment").
The recognition that the right to an accrued cause of
action did not (in the absence of an express contractual
assignment [402 F.3d 901] of such rights) automatically
follow the assignment of the copyright is necessarily a
recognition that the two rights should be capable of
being separate assets. As separate assets, like any other
property right, the two rights can be separately
alienated. That much was squarely decided in Prather,
supra.
Similar to the 1909 Act, courts have interpreted the
1976 Act to mean that an assignment of a copyright does
not automatically carry with it accrued claims unless
such claims are specifically named in the contract of
assignment. For example, in Infodek, Inc. v. MeredithWebb
Printing Co., Inc., 830 F.Supp. 614
(N.D.Ga.1993), in interpreting the 1976 Act, the court
held "the case law clearly states that a transfer of interest
for accrued damages must be stated in no uncertain
terms. It follows that the transfer of interest to past
infringements did not pass from [assignor] to [plaintiff
assignee] in the first assignment despite the alleged
intent to transfer any and all accrued damages." Infodek,
830 F.Supp. at 620 (citing Prather, 410 F.2d at 700).
The recognition under both the 1909 and 1976 Acts that
an accrued cause of action for copyright infringement is
an asset separate from the copyright or the exclusive
uses of the copyright saves 501(b) from some absurd
results.
Read as the Majority does, Section 501 of the 1976 Act
converts a claim for relief for infringement into a life
estate, by providing a cause of action for copyright
infringement but only for the person who owned the
exclusive right at the time of the infringement. The
statute would preclude an assignee of the copyright and
accrued causes of action from suing on an accrued cause
of action — which infringement, by definition was not
"committed while he or she was the owner of it."
The following result would obtain: if a copyright owner
instituted suit for copyright infringement ("while he was
the owner"), and then assigned the copyright after
instituting such suit, the assignee of the copyright and
the accrued cause of action could not maintain such suit,
for the assignee was not the owner when the
infringement occurred. In addition, the text would have
to be read such that when the "he" or "she" who owned
the exclusive right at the time of the infringement of the
copyright dies, "his" or "her" heirs cannot institute the
infringement action, for the same reason.
Luckily, Section 501(b) has not been so interpreted. See
17 U.S.C. § 501(b). Rather, the section has been
interpreted to allow the post-1976 assignee of the
accrued cause of action to maintain the suit for accrued
causes of action. Indeed, courts have recognized that
assignees of a copyright may maintain an action
instituted by the previous owner during which such
previous ownership the infringement claim arose. See,
e.g., ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 944
F.2d 971 (2d Cir.1991) (allowing plaintiff to bring suit
for copyright infringement that had occurred prior to
plaintiff's owning any copyright interest where plaintiff
was assigned the right to accrued causes of action); see
also 17 U.S.C. § 201(d)(2) (1976) ("[t]he owner of any
particular exclusive right is entitled, to the extent of that
right, to all the protection and remedies accorded to the
copyright owner.").
Accordingly, if individuals can bring suit on an accrued
infringement claim that did not accrue while he or she
was the owner, there is no reason the accrued cause of
action cannot be assigned here.
Other fundamental principles lead to the conclusion that
Congress did not intend to preclude owners of a bare
assignment of [402 F.3d 902] accrued causes of action
from having standing to bring suit.
First, it is well-established that contract rights are
assignable at common law. See Restatement (Second)
Contracts § 317(2)(b) (1979) (contract rights assignable
unless the assignment is "forbidden by statute"). See also
TransWorld Airlines, Inc. v. American Coupon
Exchange, 913 F.2d 676, 685 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that
"the presumption is in favor of assignment [of
contract]"). Here, the assignment of an accrued cause of
action for copyright infringement to an assignee is
nothing more than "simple assignment of a chose in
action." See Prather, 410 F.2d at 699-700.
As a general matter, common law rights existing prior
to the enactment of a statute remain in vigor unless
expressly abrogated by statute. "[S]tatutes which invade
the common law ... are to be read with a presumption
favoring the retention of long-established and familiar
principles, except when a statutory purpose to the
contrary is evident." United States v. Texas, 507 U.S.
529, 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245 (1993)
(holding that states remain subject to common-law
prejudgment interest liability where the federal debt
collection legislation did not directly speak to the
common law right of the federal government to collect
prejudgment interest on debts owed to it by the states)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed,
the Supreme Court recognized that "in such cases,
Congress does not write upon a clean slate." Id. Rather,
"to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must
`speak directly' to the question addressed by the
common law." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).
That is, courts will not construe a statute "in derogation
of common law" unless there is express Congressional
intent:
The courts have consistently held legislation derogative of the
common law accountable to an exactness of expression, and have
not allowed the effects of such legislation to be extended beyond the
necessary and unavoidable meaning of its terms. The presumption
runs against such innovation.
Scharfeld v. Richardson, 133 F.2d 340, 341
(D.C.Cir.1942). See also In re Chateaugay Corp., 94 F.3d
772, 779 (2d Cir.1996) ("there is nothing, either in the
language of the statute or in its legislative history, that
would lead us to believe that Congress meant the statute
to abrogate common law rights of setoff against
refunds...."); Attorney General of Canada v. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., 268 F.3d 103, 128 (2d
Cir.2001) (construing civil RICO statute to preserve the
common-law doctrine known as the "revenue rule,"
which prohibits one sovereign from enforcing tax
judgments or claims of another sovereign, "absent clear
evidence of congressional intent to abrogate it.").
In the case at bar, there is nothing in the 1976 Act which
expressly forbids the assignment of the basic contract
right at issue here.
Accordingly, the Majority errs in reasoning that
copyright "is a creature of statute, and the only rights
that exist under copyright law are those granted by
statute." Op. at 883-84. See also op. at 885. ("Copyright
is a creature of statute, so we will not lightly insert
common law principles that Congress has left out.").
This conclusion is in tension with the principle that
common law rights will be deemed to be retained except
where there is statutory language and purpose to the
contrary. This principle militates in favor of the court's
retention of the common law right to assignment of
contract. Accordingly, the Majority's reluctance to
"insert common law principles" is unfounded here [402
F.3d 903] and it errs in abrogating the right to assign
contract rights.10
Second, courts have interpreted other federal statutes
which expressly confer standing on certain persons also
to grant standing to assignees of the rights. For example,
courts have held that assignees of antitrust claims that
accrue under the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15,
have standing to sue for antitrust violations. The act
provides that "any person who shall be injured" can sue
and yet courts have interpreted the statute to confer
standing on assignees of antitrust claims. See, e.g.,
Gulfstream III Associates, Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 438-40 (3d Cir.1993) (Though the
Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides that "any
person who shall be injured" can sue, antitrust claims
are assignable).
Other federal statutes have been similarly interpreted.
See, e.g., Lerman v. Joyce Int'l, Inc., 10 F.3d 106, 112-
113 (3d Cir.1993) (RICO statute provides that "any
person injured in his business or property" may sue;
court held that RICO claims are assignable); see also
Misic v. The Building Service Employees Health and
Welfare Trust, 789 F.2d 1374, 1377-78 (9th Cir.1986)
(per curiam) (ERISA statute, 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d),
prohibited the assignment of pension benefits, but did
not expressly prohibit the assignment of health and
welfare benefits; though the statute, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a),
provides that: "A civil action may be brought by a
participant or beneficiary ... to recover benefits due to
him under the terms of his plan," (emphasis added),
health and welfare claims are assignable).
III.
Next, the Majority argues that the case law that has
developed in the area of patent law is analogous here.
With respect, it is not. In particular, the Majority asserts
that the U.S. Supreme Court's 1923 decision in Crown
Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U.S.
24, 43 S.Ct. 254, 67 L.Ed. 516 (1923) (per Taft, C.J.),
dealing with the question of whether an accrued cause
of action for patent infringement, is analogous and,
indeed, controls here. I respectfully disagree.
In Crown Die, inventors Wright & Hubbard invented a
machine for forming a screw-thread cutting device. Id.
at 25, 43 S.Ct. 254. Wright & Hubbard assigned the
patent to the Reed Manufacturing Company ("Reed").
Id. Thereafter, Nye Tool & Machine Works ("Nye
Tool"), first obtained from Reed "all claims recoverable
in law or in equity, whether for damages, profits,
savings, or any other kind or description which the
Reed Manufacturing Company has against the Crown
Die & Tool Company arising out of the infringement by
the Crown Die & Tool Company." Id. at 26, 43 S.Ct.
254. Nye Tool then brought suit to prevent Crown Die
& Tool Company ("Crown Die"), a tool company and
competitor, from using the screw-thread cutting device.
Id. at 24, 43 S.Ct. 254. While not stated in the opinion,
it stands to reason that plaintiff Nye Tool brought suit
under the Patent Act of 1874, which provided that a
"patentee, assignee, or grantee" could bring suit for
patent infringement.11
[402 F.3d 904] Crown Die moved to dismiss the
complaint on the grounds that Nye Tool did not have
standing to bring suit, for Reed owned the patent and
had only granted Nye Tool a portion of its rights
thereunder. Id. at 27, 43 S.Ct. 254. The court of appeals
reversed the district court's order granting defendant's
motion to dismiss and the U.S. Supreme Court reversed
the court of appeals. Id. at 36, 43 S.Ct. 254. In reversing
the court of appeals and affirming the district court's
dismissal of the complaint, Chief Justice Taft reasoned
that the common law doctrine of assignment of a cause
of action does not apply to patent law because patent
law is a creation of statute. Id. More specifically, Chief
Justice Taft reasoned that the patent right was "created
by the act of Congress; and no rights can be acquired in
it unless authorized by statute, and in the manner the
statute prescribes." Id. at 40, 43 S.Ct. 254 (quoting
Gayler v. Wilder, 51 U.S. 477, 494, 10 How. 477, 13
L.Ed. 504 (1850)).
In so holding, the court reasoned that there was no
legislative intent to permit splitting of the claim from
the underlying right because to do so would result in an
aftermarket in patent claims.12 The court reasoned that:
[I]t was obviously not the intention of the Legislature to permit
several monopolies to be made out of one, and divided among
different persons within the same limits. Such a division would
inevitably lead to fraudulent impositions upon persons who desired
to purchase the use of the improvement, and would subject a party
who, under a mistake as to his rights, used the invention without
authority, to be harassed by a multiplicity of suits instead of one,
and to successive recoveries of damages by different persons in the
same place.
Id. at 38, 43 S.Ct. 254 (quoting Gayler v. Wilder, 51 U.S.
477, 494, 10 How. 477, 13 L.Ed. 504 (1850)) (internal
quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).
First, in contrast to the Chief Justice's 1923 reading of
an 1874 Patent Law, it clearly was the intent of the 1976
Legislature to "permit several monopolies to be made of
one," insofar as the six individual [402 F.3d 905] and
separate uses of a single copyright (Section 201(d)) could
not only be "divided among different persons," but
subdivided infinitely. See 17 U.S.C. § 201(d).
Second, avoidance of fraud upon purchasers of "several"
copyright uses was to be avoided by regulation:
copyright registration. See 1909 Act, Section 12 (1909)
("no action or proceeding shall be maintained for
infringement of copyright in any work until the
provisions of this Act with respect to the deposit of
copies and registration of such work shall have been
complied with").13 Accord, 17 U.S.C. § 411(a) (1976)
("[n]o action for infringement of the copyright in any
work shall be instituted until registration of the
copyright claim has been made in accordance with this
title.").
Third, the concern of multiplicity of suits14 because of
several owners of copyright uses seems expressly
overcome by allowing suit by the owner of "an" (not
"all") exclusive right (§ 501(b)) to bring suit.
Moreover, while the notion of severability of the
incidents of ownership of property was in its infancy in
1923 at the time Crown Die was decided, such is not the
case today. Indeed, the underlying premise upon which
the Majority relies is that there should not be an
aftermarket in causes of action for copyright
infringement. Given the growth of an aftermarket in
derivative rights such as puts, calls and credit insurance
against bankruptcy risks on corporate debt, the notion
that an aftermarket in accrued causes of action for
copyright infringement is to be prohibited is at best
passe and at worst an unwarranted restraint on
alienation. See Bank of America, N.A. v. Moglia, 330
F.3d 942, 947 (7th Cir.2003) (Posner, J.) ("restraint[s] on
alienation are traditionally disfavored."). Indeed, such
limitations, on those able to bring suit, harken back to
the Tudor Kings of England who limited inheritance to
primogeniture and descent by fee tail.
Here, the market will account for the fact that a
copyright holder is selling accrued causes of action and
not the underlying copyright. To be sure, prices will
fluctuate depending on whether the copyright itself is
included.
Finally, while courts have recognized that "[w]here
precedent in copyright cases is lacking, it is appropriate
to look for guidance to patent law `because of the
historic kinship between patent law and copyright law,'"
(see op. at 887) (internal citation omitted), courts have
also recognized that "[these] two areas of the law,
naturally, are not identical twins, and we exercise the
caution which we have expressed in the past in applying
doctrine formulated in one area to the other." Sony
Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464
U.S. 417, 439 n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574
(1984). See also Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217-218,
74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) (declining to apply
patent law to copyright law due to differences in bodies
of law). For these reasons, Crown Die does not compel a
contrary result here.15
[402 F.3d 906] IV.
Unlike circumstances in which the proliferation of
lawsuits has been restrained on the basis of public
policy, such as the prohibition on assignment of
personal injury claims in tort, here there is no reason to
prevent the assignment of a copyright claim. Indeed, the
court in Prather expressly held there was no such public
policy. See Prather, 410 F.2d at 700 ("[t]here is no public
policy against such assignments.").
Courts have upheld restrictions on the assignment of
claims where such assignment has been deemed to be in
violation of public policy. This anti-assignment policy
was rooted in the common law prohibition on
champerty.16 See, e.g., United Food & Commercial
Workers & Employers Arizona Health & Welfare Trust
v. Pacyga, 801 F.2d 1157, 1159 (9th Cir.1986) (noting
that assignment of personal injury claims is prohibited
by common law in Arizona); See also DeSenne v.
Jamestown Boat Yard, Inc., 968 F.2d 1388, 1390 (1st
Cir.1992) (noting that anti-assignment of personal
injury claims rooted in prohibition on champerty).
Similarly, courts have held that legal malpractice claims
are not assignable for public policy reasons. See, e.g.,
Forgione v. Dennis Pirtle Agency, Inc., 93 F.3d 758, 760
(11th Cir.1996) ("[a] majority of jurisdictions prohibit
the assignment of [legal malpractice] actions because the
personal nature of legal services which involve highly
confidential relationships") (internal quotation and
citation omitted). Moreover, courts have upheld
restrictions on in-person attorney solicitation, enacted
to prevent the public's perception of attorneys from
falling in further disrepute, as rooted in the common
law doctrine of barratry.17 See Florida Bar v. Went For
It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 626, 115 S.Ct. 2371, 132 L.Ed.2d
541 (1995). See also Bailey v. Morales, 190 F.3d 320, 323
(5th Cir.1999) (legal profession barred from soliciting
under ancient doctrine prohibiting barratry).
In addition, courts have upheld restrictions on
assignment of certain federal claims where assignment
of such claims would result in nuisance suits. For
example, in Smith v. Ayres, 977 F.2d 946, 950 (5th
Cir.1992), the plaintiff shareholder brought suit under
section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
which provides that "purchasers or sellers" of securities
may bring suit. The plaintiff had been granted an
express assignment of the claim. The defendant moved
to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff lacked standing
and the district court granted the motion. The Fifth
Circuit affirmed, concluding that such a result was
warranted by (1) the fact that "Congress was concerned
with blackmail, nuisance, and strike suits, and drafted
the act to circumscribe the class of plaintiffs who may
sue under the Act for the very purpose of eliminating
such suits" and (2) "the evidentiary problems inherent
[402 F.3d 907] in allowing a non-purchaser or nonseller
to bring a Rule 10b-5 action." Id. at 950 (internal
citations omitted).
None of such policy concerns underlie the Majority's
opinion. Nor indeed is there a reasoned policy
consideration given for prohibiting suit upon an accrued
cause of action for infringement.18
V.
In reaching its conclusion, the Majority argues that this
circuit should follow the Second Circuit's decision in
Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., Inc., 697
F.2d 27 (2d Cir.1982) to avoid the creation of a circuit
split. See op. at 889-90. In my view, Eden Toys is
inapposite. To avoid the creation of a circuit split, this
circuit should rather follow the rationale of Prather.
A. Prather v. Neva Paperbacks, Inc.
In Prather v. Neva Paperbacks, Inc., 410 F.2d 698
(1969), the Fifth Circuit squarely held that an assignee of
an accrued cause of action is a proper party to bring suit
for copyright infringement. In my view, this case
provides persuasive authority that this circuit should
follow.
Plaintiff Prather ("Prather") was the author of several
books. Prather held the copyright on one of the books
and the copyright to the remaining books was held by
Prather's publisher, Fawcett Publications. Prather
discovered that the copyright on one of the books (the
rights to which were owned by Fawcett) had been
infringed by book publisher Neva Paperbacks, Inc.
("Neva"). After discovering the infringement, Prather
obtained some of the copyright rights and an
assignment of all present, past and future causes of
action.19 Significantly, however, Fawcett
"simultaneously" with assigning the copyright to
Prather, retained an exclusive license to the English
language rights for books throughout the world. Id. at
699 n. 1.
Prather brought suit against Neva for copyright
infringement. Neva moved to dismiss, arguing that
plaintiff Prather did not have standing to bring suit
because Prather was not the "proprietor" of the
copyright as required under the 1909 Act. See 17 U.S.C.
§ 101(a) (1952). Rather, Neva argued that because the
copyright rights had been "split," Prather was a mere
"licensee" and not the sole "proprietor" under Section
101.
The Fifth Circuit affirmed the trial court's denial of the
defendant's motion to dismiss and held that Prather did,
in fact, have standing to sue. In so holding, the Fifth
Circuit reasoned that the assignment was simply a
"simple assignment of a chose in action" — a contract —
that contained express language of assignment. See
Prather, 410 F.2d at 699-700. The court concluded:
As an assignee of the causes of action for infringement damages
past, present and future, Prather has the right to maintain the
action under 17 U.S.C.A. [§] § 101 et seq. For infringement. There
is no public policy against such assignments and under
F[ED].R.CIV.P. 17 such assignee of all choses in action for
infringement, whether a `proprietor' or not, has standing to sue and
the court [402 F.3d 908] has effective power to avoid altogether the
risk of double suit or double recovery.
Id. at 700 (emphasis added).
Under Prather, then, courts will not require plaintiff to
hold ownership of one or more of the exclusive rights of
a copyright owner to have standing.
The Majority states that Prather is "unhelpful" authority
for two reasons: (1) it was decided under the 1909 Act,
and not the 1976 Act; and (2) "the assignment in Prather
involved both accrued causes of action and some of what
we now call exclusive rights." Op. at 889 (emphasis in
original). The Majority argues "the Prather court was
not faced, as we are, with a situation in which the owner
of all the exclusive rights and the owner of the accrued
causes of action are two different people." Op. at 889.
Neither distinction is persuasive.
First, the Majority's attempt to distinguish Prather as
predicated on the 1909 Act is unpersuasive, given that
courts have recognized that "[i]n enacting § 501(b)'s
standing provision, Congress `merely codified the case
law that had developed [under the 1909 Act] with
respect to the beneficial owner's standing to sue.'"20
Moran v. London Records, Ltd., 827 F.2d 180, 183 (7th
Cir.1987) (internal citation omitted). See also Gardner,
279 F.3d at 778 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that a
sublicensee of a copyright lacked standing to sue under
the 1976 Act on the ground that the pre-1976 law so
prohibited).21 Accord, H.R. 94-1476 at 47, reprinted in
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5660 ("[t]he present copyright
law, title 17 of the United States Code, is basically the
same as the act of 1909.").
Second, that Prather owned rights to the books (other
than the English language rights), Neva argued, made
Prather a licensee of book rights — not the owner of
what we would now call "exclusive rights." An assignee
could not be the owner of book rights because the
"exclusive right" to republish could not be split away
from the copyright under the 1909 Act; that is precisely
what the 1976 Act changed. Licensees did not have
standing to bring suit under the 1909 Act. Therefore,
Prather, as a (mere) licensee, could not have had
standing to sue but for his standing as the assignee of an
"accrued cause of action for infringement." See, e.g.,
Gardner, 279 F.3d at 778 ("only the copyright proprietor
(which would include an assignee but not a licensee) had
standing to bring an infringement action.").
Moreover, the assignment to Prather of "some rights"
did not help Prather establish his right to sue; just the
opposite. The fact that he got "some" but not "all" rights
of copyright was used by the defendants to undermine
his standing and was in no sense a grounds used by the
Prather court to validate the assignment. Indeed, [402
F.3d 909] the court rejected this argument and refused
to get into the "metaphysical dialectic" of the "button
game" of determining who had the copyright. Prather,
410 F.2d at 699.
In my view, to interpret Prather as holding that an
assignee of an accrued cause of action was required to be
an assignee of some rights under the copyright would be
a profound misreading of the case. Rather than essential
to establish standing, having (only) some rights made
out what defendant Neva urged as an affirmative
defense.
B. Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., Inc.
By contrast, the Second Circuit's decision in Eden Toys,
Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., Inc., 697 F.2d 27 (2d
Cir.1982) involves a different factual situation and thus
is entitled to little weight here.
In Eden Toys, Paddington Bear & Company, Ltd.
("Paddington Bear") held the copyright to children's
books which featured the fictional character Paddington
Bear. Id. at 29. In 1975, Paddington Bear entered into an
agreement with Eden Toys, Inc. ("Eden Toys"), an
American corporation, whereby Eden Toys was granted
an exclusive license to use licensor Paddington Bear's
copyright and characters in North America. Id. In 1980,
that agreement was amended to grant Eden Toys
exclusive North American rights to all Paddington
products except books, tapes, records, stage plays,
motion pictures, radio and television productions. Id. at
30. Under the agreement, Paddington Bear retained the
right to sue for copyright infringement on Eden Toys'
license. Id. In particular, the agreement allowed
Paddington Bear to sue, or choose not to, but let Eden
Toys bring suits on Paddington's behalf.22 Id. at 30 n. 2.
Eden Toys brought suit against Florelee Undergarment
Co. ("Florelee"), alleging copyright infringement, and
seeking to enjoin Florelee's use of the Paddington Bear
image. Id. at 31. Florelee moved to dismiss the
complaint on the ground that Eden Toys lacked
standing to sue under 17 U.S.C. § 501(b) (1976). Id. The
Second Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of
the claim, holding that "[the court] do[es] not believe
that the [1976] Copyright Act permits holders of rights
under copyrights to choose third parties to bring suits
on their behalf." Id. at 32 n. 3.
The Majority contends that the court in Eden Toys
"made plain the basic principle, which we also have
derived from § 501(b) and its context and history, that
only the owner of an exclusive right under the copyright
is entitled to sue for infringement." Op. at 889.
I respectfully disagree. In my view, the holding of Eden
Toys is far more narrow. The court in Eden Toys held
that a copyright holder who maintains ownership of the
exclusive right to reproduce cannot assign to a third
party the bare right to sue should the copyright holder
choose not to do so. It does not hold that a copyright
holder may not assign the accrued cause of action, on
which a new owner can sue.
[402 F.3d 910] Indeed, the specific contractual
agreement between Eden Toys and Paddington Bear did
not (as it does here) assign all rights to any claims, but
merely assigned the right to sue where Eden Toys or its
licensees was "exposed to competition, direct or indirect,
from infringers of the copyright or trademark rights
which are licensed hereunder." Id. at 30 n. 2. There was
no assignment to Eden Toys of pre-existing accrued
causes of action. Accordingly, there was no real
"assignment" of any accrued cause of action. Rather, the
Eden-Paddington Bear agreement was interpreted as an
agreement merely designating Eden as the agent for
purposes of suit. Thus, Eden Toys merely holds that the
proper party plaintiff, the "real party in interest," is the
owner of the cause of action for infringement, not some
hand-picked stand-in.
C. ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd.
Finally, I respectfully disagree with the Majority's
reading of the Second Circuit's decision in ABKCO
Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 944 F.2d 971 (2d
Cir.1990). Far from "reaffirm[ing] the principle of Eden
Toys that a party that has no ownership interest has no
standing to sue," as the Majority asserts (op. at 889-90),
in my view, the decision clearly holds that copyright
ownership is not the sine qua non of standing, but that
assignees of accrued causes of action may sue for
copyright infringement.
In 1971, Bright Tunes Music Corporation, which owned
the copyright to a song entitled "He's So Fine," sued
musician (and Beatles band member) George Harrison
and Harrisongs Music claiming that Harrison's tune "My
Sweet Lord" infringed Bright Tunes' copyright. The
trial court agreed and ruled in favor of Bright Tunes, but
reserved judgment on the issue of damages. Id. at 975.
In 1971, at the time Bright Tunes sued Harrison,
ABKCO Music, Inc. and its president served as business
manager for the Beatles. Id. at 975. In 1978, ABKCO
purchased all of Bright Tunes' interest in "He's So Fine"
including the copyright and "any and all rights assertable
under copyright against the infringing composition
("My Sweet Lord") in any part of the world which may
have heretofore arisen or which may arise hereafter." Id.
at 980. Accordingly, ABKCO was substituted as the sole
party plaintiff in the action against Harrisongs Music. Id.
at 975. However, Harrison had claims against ABKCO
and its principal Klein which required ABKCO to
convey the old Bright Tunes copyright to "He's So Fine"
to Harrison on the payment of a sum.
On appeal, ABKCO claimed that if it conveyed the old
Bright Tunes "He's So Fine" copyright to Harrison, it
could not participate in the 1980 foreign settlements and
it would lose its pre-1970 infringement claims.
As concerns us, the dispositive question was a
determination of what rights were at issue in the 1980
foreign settlements: ABKCO's possession of the
copyright to "He's So Fine" or merely its ownership of
the infringement claims. The Second Circuit held it was
merely the ownership of the infringement claims, and
held that ABKCO's right to bring the claims derived
from its ownership of the accrued infringement claims.
In so holding, the Second Circuit noted that although
ABKCO now owned the copyright and the accrued
infringement claims, it need not continue to own the
copyright to enforce its accrued-in-1970 causes of action
for copyright infringement arising from the 1980
settlement. The court reasoned:
[402 F.3d 911] Hence, the claims had already accrued when ABKCO
purchased all of Bright Tunes' rights in "He's So Fine." As a
consequence, ABKCO's right to bring the claims arises not out of its
ownership of the copyright, but from its ownership of the claims
themselves which it purchased, along with the copyright, in 1978.
We therefore conclude that ABKCO's ownership of the "He's So
Fine" copyrights was not a necessary predicate to its participation in
the 1980 settlements. ABKCO could participate in the 1980
settlements because it owned the infringement claims accrued in
1970, not because it owned the copyright. Thus, ABKCO's
ownership of the copyright was not affected by the 1980
settlements, and ABKCO must surrender the copyright to the
Harrison Interests upon proper payment.
Id. at 980-981 (emphasis added).
Thus, under the holding in ABKCO, ownership of the
copyright is not a requirement for the enforcement of
accrued claims assigned to the assignee (ABKCO) so
long as the claims arose during the period when the
assignor (Bright Tunes) was the owner of the copyright.
Moreover, ABKCO could continue to assert such
accrued copyright infringement claims even though it
would be forced to give up the copyright.
According to the Majority, "[t]he Second Circuit [in
ABKCO] made clear that its decision was limited to the
situation in which the same entity purchased both the
copyright and accrued claims; the only issue was one of
timing, whether ownership of the copyright and
occurrence of the infringement had to coincide." Op. at
___. I respectfully disagree. In ABKCO, ownership of
both the copyright and the accrued causes of action was
merely coincident — not required — for ABKCO to have
standing to sue.
Indeed, ABKCO, like Silvers, did not own the copyright
to "He's So Fine" when George Harrison and the Beatles
plagiarized it into "My Sweet Lord." The copyright to
"He's So Fine" was owned by Bright Tunes; the
infringements took place before 1970.
In the case at bar, there is no dispute that Frank & Bob
Films II owned the copyright when the alleged Sony
infringement took place and that they, like Bright
Tunes, assigned those accrued infringement claims to
Silvers. Thus, like ABKCO, Silvers has standing to
pursue those accrued infringement claims.
Accordingly, I respectfully disagree with the Majority: to
avoid the creation of a circuit-split, op. at 889-90, this
court should follow the Fifth Circuit's decision in
Prather, rather than the Second Circuit's decision in
Eden Toys, as the facts in Eden Toys are clearly
distinguishable. In addition, in ABKCO, a more recent
decision, the Second Circuit expressly held that
ownership of both the copyright and the accrued causes
of action is not necessary for the owner of those claims
to bring suit.
VI.
For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district
court's denial of Sony's motion to dismiss Silvers'
complaint against Sony for the alleged infringement of
the copyright of her script, "The Other Woman." I
respectfully dissent.
