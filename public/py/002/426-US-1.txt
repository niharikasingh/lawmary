The issue in this case is whether the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority under the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), as
amended in 1972, 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C. § 1251 et seq.
(1970 ed., Supp. IV), to regulate the discharge into the
[426 U.S. 4] Nation's waterways of nuclear waste
materials subject to regulation by the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) and its successors under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954 (AEA). 68 Stat. 919, as amended, 42
U. S. C. § 2011 et seq. In statutory terms, the question is
whether these nuclear materials are "pollutants" within
the meaning of the FWPCA.
I
Respondents are Colorado-based organizations and
Colorado residents who claim potential harm from the
discharge of radioactive effluents from two nuclear
plants—the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station
and the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons components plant.
These facilities are operated in conformity with
radioactive effluent standards imposed by the AEC
pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act. The dispute in this
case arises because the EPA has disclaimed any authority
under the FWPCA to set standards of its own to govern
the discharge of radioactive materials subject to
regulation under the AEA. Respondents, taking issue
with the EPA'S disclaimer of authority, brought this suit
against petitioners, the EPA and its Administrator,
under § 505 of the FWPCA, 33 U. S. C. § 1365 (1970
ed., Supp. IV), which authorizes "citizen suits" against
the Administrator for failure to perform
nondiscretionary duties under the FWPCA. They
sought a declaration that the definition of a "pollutant"
under the FWPCA encompasses all radioactive
materials, including those regulated under the terms of
the AEA, and an injunction directing the EPA and its
Administrator to regulate the discharge of all such
radioactive materials.
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the United
States District Court for the District of Colorado held
that the AEC had exclusive authority to regulate
discharges of radioactive materials covered by the AEA.
[426 U.S. 5] 373 F.Supp. 991 (1974). The Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the
FWPCA requires the EPA to regulate discharges into
the Nation's waters of all radioactive materials,
including those covered by the AEA. 507 F.2d 743
(1974). Because of the importance of the issue involved
in this case, we granted certiorari. 421 U.S. 998 (1975).
We now reverse.
II
Since 1946, when the first Atomic Energy Act was
passed, 60 Stat. 755, the Federal Government has
exercised control over the production and use of atomic
energy through the AEC—replaced since the
commencement of this litigation by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Energy
Research and Development Administration (ERDA).1
Under the AEA, private parties are permitted to engage
in the production of atomic energy for industrial or
commercial purposes, but only in accordance with
licenses issued by the AEC (NRC) in the furtherance of
the purposes of the Act. 42 U. S. C. § 2133.
The comprehensive regulatory scheme created by the
AEA embraces the production, possession, and use of
three types of radioactive materials—source material,2
[426 U.S. 6] special nuclear material,3 and byproduct
material.4 In carrying out its regulatory duties under the
AEA, the AEC is authorized to establish "such standards
. . . as [it] may deem necessary or desirable . . . to protect
health or to minimize danger to life or property." 42 U.
S. C. § 2201 (b). See also 42 U. S. C. §§ 2073 (b), (e),
2093 (b), 2111, 2133 (a), (d), 2134 (d). Pursuant to this
authority, the AEC (NRC) has established by regulation
maximum permissible releases of source, byproduct, and
special nuclear materials into the environment by
licensees. 10 CFR § 20.106 and App. B, Table II (1976).
The regulations further provide that licensees should, in
addition to complying with the established limits, "make
every reasonable effort to maintain . . . releases of
radioactive materials in effluents . . . as low as is
reasonably achievable." 10 CFR § 20.1 (c) (1976).
Similarly, the regulations require that nuclear facilities
be designed to keep levels of radioactive material in
effluents "as low as is reasonably achievable." 10 CFR §
50.34a (1976). See also 10 CFR §§ 50.36a, 50.57 (a) (3),
(6) (1976).5
[426 U.S. 7] The FWPCA established a regulatory
program to control and abate water pollution, stating as
its ultimate objective the elimination of all discharges of
"pollutants" into the navigable waters by 1985. In
furtherance of this objective, the FWPCA calls for the
achievement of effluent limitations that require
applications of the "best practicable control technology
currently available" by July 1, 1977, and the "best
available technology economically achievable" by July 1,
1983. 33 U. S. C. § 1311 (b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). These
effluent limitations are enforced through a permit
program. The discharge of "pollutants" into water is
unlawful without a permit issued by the Administrator
of the EPA or, if a State has developed a program that
complies with the FWPCA, by the State.6 33 U. S. C. §§
1311 (a), 1342 (1970 ed., Supp. IV).
The term "pollutant" is defined by the FWPCA to
include, inter alia, "radioactive materials."7 But when
[426 U.S. 8] the Administrator of the EPA adopted
regulations governing the permit program, 40 CFR, pt.
125 (1975), he specifically excluded source, byproduct,
and special nuclear materials—those covered by the
AEA—from the program upon his understanding of the
relevant legislative history of the FWPCA:
"The legislative history of the Act reflects that the term `radioactive
materials' as included within the definition of `pollutant' in section
502 of the Act covers only radioactive materials which are not
encompassed in the definition of source, byproduct, or special
nuclear materials as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended, and regulated pursuant to the latter Act. Examples of
radioactive materials not covered by the Atomic Energy Act and,
therefore, included within the term `pollutant' are radium and
accelerator produced isotopes." 40 CFR § 125.1 (y) (1975) (citations
omitted).8
It was the Administrator's exclusion of source,
byproduct, and special nuclear materials from the permit
program, and consequent refusal to regulate them, that
[426 U.S. 9] precipitated the instant lawsuit. The
question we are presented with, then, is whether source,
byproduct, and special nuclear materials are "pollutants"
within the meaning of the FWPCA.
III
The Court of Appeals resolved the question exclusively
by reference to the language of the statute. It observed
that the FWPCA defines "pollution" as "the man-made
or man-induced alteration of the chemical, physical,
biological, and radiological integrity of water." 33 U. S.
C. § 1362 (19) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). And it noted that
the reference to "radioactive materials" in the definition
of "pollutant" was without express qualification or
exception, despite the fact that the overall definition of
"pollutant" does contain two explicit exceptions.9 The
court concluded from this analysis of the language that
by the reference to "radioactive materials" Congress
meant all radioactive materials. The court explained:
"In our view, then, the statute is plain and unambiguous and should
be given its obvious meaning. Such being the case, . . . we need not
here concern ourselves with the legislative history of the 1972
Amendments. In this regard we would note parenthetically that in
our view the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments is
conflicting and inconclusive. Be that as it may, in the case before us
there is no need to address ourselves to the ofttimes difficult task of
ascertaining legislative intent through legislative history. Here, the
legislative intent is clearly manifested in the language of the statute
itself, and we need not resort to legislative history." 507 F. 2d, at
748 (citations omitted).
To the extent that the Court of Appeals excluded [426
U.S. 10] reference to the legislative history of the
FWPCA in discerning its meaning, the court was in
error. As we have noted before: "When aid to
construction of the meaning of words, as used in the
statute, is available, there certainly can be no `rule of
law' which forbids its use, however clear the words may
appear on `superficial examination.' " United States v.
American Trucking Assns., 310 U.S. 534, 543-544
(1940) (footnotes omitted). See Cass v. United States,
417 U.S. 72, 77-79 (1974). See generally Murphy, Old
Maxims Never Die: The "Plain-Meaning Rule" and
Statutory Interpretation in the "Modern" Federal
Courts, 75 Col. L. Rev. 1299 (1975). In this case, as we
shall see, the legislative history sheds considerable light
on the question before the Court.
Before turning to the various legislative materials,
however, we pause to consider an additional argument
asserted by respondents on the basis of the language of
the statute. Section 1311 (f), they note, provides as
follows:
"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter it shall be
unlawful to discharge any radiological, chemical, or biological
warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste into the navigable
waters." 33 U. S. C. § 1311 (f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).
Respondents suggest that it would be inconsistent for
Congress in one section of the FWPCA to prohibit the
discharge of "radiological warfare agents" and "highlevel
radioactive waste," both of which are subject to
AEA regulation, while at the same time exempting
AEA-regulated materials from the FWPCA'S permit
program. We see no inconsistency. That Congress has
chosen to ban completely the discharge of certain highlevel
radioactive material regulated under the AEA does
not, by itself, indicate whether Congress wanted the
discharge of other radioactive material regulated under
the AEA to be [426 U.S. 11] subject to the FWPCA'S
permit program. Respondents argue further, however,
that Congress' use of the phrase "[n]otwithstanding any
other provisions of this chapter" before the ban on the
discharge of high-level radioactive waste suggests that
the discharge of such material would otherwise be
subject to the FWPCA'S permit program. This
argument is not entirely without logical appeal, but we
do not consider it determinative. Like the more general
argument based on the definition of a "pollutant" as
including "radioactive materials," this argument must be
assessed against the background of the relevant
legislative history.
IV
The legislative history of the FWPCA speaks with force
to the question whether source, byproduct, and special
nuclear materials are "pollutants" subject to the Act's
permit program. The House Committee Report was
quite explicit on the subject:
"The term `pollutant' as defined in the bill includes `radioactive
materials.' These materials are those not encompassed in the
definition of source, byproduct, or special nuclear materials as
defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
regulated pursuant to that Act. `Radioactive materials' encompassed
by this bill are those beyond the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy
Commission. Examples of radioactive material not covered by the
Atomic Energy Act, and, therefore, included within the term
`pollutant,' are radium and accelerator produced isotopes." H. R.
Rep. No. 92-911, p. 131 (1972), 1 Leg. Hist. 818 (emphasis added).10
[426 U.S. 12] The definition of "pollutant" in the House
version of the bill, H. R. 11896, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., §
502 (6) (1972), 1 Leg. Hist. 1068, contained the same
broad reference to "radioactive materials" as did the
definition in the Senate bill, S. 2770, 92d Cong., 1st
Sess., § 502 (f) (1971), 2 Leg. Hist. 1697, and the bill
ultimately enacted as the FWPCA; for our purposes the
definitions are identical. Moreover, the House version
of the bill contained the provision now codified as §
1311 (f), banning the discharge of radiological warfare
agents and high-level radioactive waste
"[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of this Act." H.
R. 11896, supra, § 301 (e), 1 Leg. Hist. 965. Thus, the
House Committee, describing the import of the precise
statutory language with which we are concerned,
cautioned that the definition of "pollutant" did not
include those radioactive materials subject to regulation
under the AEA.
Respondents claim to find in the Senate Committee
Report an indication that the statutory definition of
"pollutant" embraces radioactive materials subject to
AEA regulation. Section 306 of the Senate bill, which
corresponds to 33 U. S. C. § 1316 (1970 ed., Supp. IV),
required that the EPA Administrator establish
"standards of performance" with respect to the discharge
of pollutants from specified categories of sources, to be
revised from time to time by the Administrator. The
Senate Committee Report noted that nuclear fuels
processing plants were not included, because the EPA
did not then have "the technical capability to establish
controls for such plants." S. Rep. No. 92-414, p. 59
(1971), 2 Leg. Hist. 1477. The Report then observed that
the Committee "expects that EPA will develop the
capability," and continued:
"The Bureau of Radiological Health, which was transferred to the
Environmental Protection Agency, [426 U.S. 13] should have the
capacity to determine those levels of control which can be achieved
for nuclear fuels processing plants. If they do not, such a capability
should be developed and this particular source should be added to
the list of new sources as soon as possible." Ibid.
Petitioners assert that this statement by the Committee
has no bearing on the question before the Court. The
statement, petitioners suggest, reflects no more than a
recognition, shared by them, that the plants referred to
were not intended to be wholly excluded from the reach
of the FWPCA—a recognition that in their view means
that the EPA can control the discharge from such plants
of polluting materials other than source, byproduct, and
special nuclear materials. In short, petitioners contend
that the statement sheds no light on the question
whether source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials
are pollutants under the FWPCA.
We agree with the petitioners that the Senate
Committee statement is addressed to the inclusion of
nuclear fuels processing plants in the category of sources
subject to the EPA'S control, not to the inclusion of any
particular materials within the definition of "pollutant."
It is true that the reference to the development of
control levels by the Bureau of Radiological Health11
does permit the inference that the Committee was
contemplating controls over the discharge of AEAregulated
radioactive materials. Still, we are not
prepared to attribute greater significance to this
inference than to the more explicit statement contained
in the House Committee Report, a statement that, as we
shall see, is amply [426 U.S. 14] supported by the
discussion on the floors of the House and the Senate.
A colloquy on the Senate floor between Senator Pastore,
the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy, and Senator Muskie, the FWPCA'S primary
author, provides a strong indication that Congress did
not intend the FWPCA to alter the AEC'S control over
the discharge of source, byproduct, and special nuclear
materials. Senator Pastore, referring to the need to
define what materials are "subject to control
requirements" under the FWPCA, noted that the
definition of "pollutant" included the words "radioactive
materials." 2 Leg. Hist. 1265. The following exchange
then took place:
"MR. PASTORE. . . .
"My question is this: Does this measure that has been reported by
the committee in any way affect the existing law, that is, the
existing Atomic Energy Act of 1954, insofar as the regulatory
powers of the AEC are concerned with reference to radioactive
material?
"MR. MUSKIE. It does not; and it is not the intent of this act to
affect the 1954 legislation.
"MR. PASTORE. In other words, this bill does not change that
feature of the Atomic Energy Act in any regard?
"MR. MUSKIE. That is correct.
"MR. PASTORE. I thank the Senator.
"MR. MUSKIE. May I say in addition, that legislation dealing with
the setting of effluent limitations as they involve nuclear
powerplants is now pending in the courts. The Senator is aware of
that litigation.
"For example, a recent decision of the U. S. Court [426 U.S. 15] of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in the case of Northern States
Power and Light versus Minnesota, raises the issue. I would like to
point out that the committee considered speaking specifically to
that decision, but chose to remain silent so as not to prejudice the
decision or any appeal from it.
"MR. PASTORE. Yes. As a matter of fact, that decision held that
the Federal Government did preempt in this field under existing
law. That is the opinion, and we hope this legislation does not
change that opinion in any way, and does not affect existing law.
That is all I am concerned with.
"MR. MUSKIE. The Senator is correct in his evaluation of the
legislation on that point." Id., at 1265-1266.
Respondents contend that this colloquy "merely
reiterates that the FWPCA does not alter the regulatory
authority of the AEC" over source, byproduct, and
special nuclear materials. Brief for Respondents 40-41.
The exchange, they assert, says nothing about the EPA'S
authority to regulate the same materials. The discussion
is consistent, they claim, with their position that the
AEC must defer to the EPA in the setting of effluent
limitations for AEA-regulated materials—that, for
example, NRC licenses must conform to permits issued
under the FWPCA. We disagree.
The thrust of Senator Muskie's assurances that the
FWPCA would not "in any way affect" the regulatory
powers of the AEC was, we think, that the AEC was to
retain full authority to regulate the materials covered by
the AEA, unaltered by the exercise of regulatory
authority by any agency under the FWPCA. This
conclusion is reinforced by Senator Muskie's reference
to the case of Northern States Power Co. v. Minnesota,
447 F.2d 1143 (CA8 1971). In that case, which was
subsequently [426 U.S. 16] affirmed summarily by this
Court, 405 U.S. 1035 (1972), the Eighth Circuit had held
that the AEA created a pervasive regulatory scheme,
vesting exclusive authority to regulate the discharge of
radioactive effluents from nuclear power plants in the
AEC, and pre-empting the States from regulating such
discharges. The absence of any room for a state role
under the AEA in setting limits on radioactive
discharges from nuclear power plants12 stands in sharp
contrast to the scheme created by the FWPCA, which
envisions the development of state permit programs, 33
U. S. C. §§ 1342 (b), (c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), and allows
the States to adopt effluent limitations more stringent
than those required or established under the FWPCA.
33 U. S. C. § 1370 (1970 ed., Supp. IV). See also 33 U. S.
C. §§ 1311 (b) (1) (C), 1314 (b), 1316 (c), 1341 (a) (1)
(1970 ed., Supp. IV).13 Senator [426 U.S. 17] Muskie's
specific assurance to Senator Pastore that the FWPCA
would not affect existing law as interpreted in Northern
States can only be viewed, we think, as an indication
that the exclusive regulatory scheme created by the AEA
for source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials was
to remain unaltered.14
In the course of the House's consideration of the
FWPCA, an unsuccessful attempt was made to alter the
AEA'S scheme for regulating the discharge of the
radioactive materials involved in this case.
Representative Wolff proposed to amend what is now
33 U. S. C. § 1370 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which gives
States the authority to set more stringent limits on the
discharge of pollutants, by adding a paragraph giving the
States the authority to regulate the discharge of
radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants. The
debate on that amendment and its defeat by a 3-to-1
vote provide solid [426 U.S. 18] support for the
conclusion that the FWPCA'S grant of regulatory
authority to the EPA and the States did not encompass
the control of AEA-regulated materials.
The Wolff amendment, according to its author, would
"give the States a voice in deciding what kinds and
amounts of such radioactive wastes may be discharged
into their waters." 1 Leg. Hist. 544. In explaining the
need for such an amendment, Representative Wolff
noted that the time had come "to seriously consider
standards more stringent than those promulgated by the
AEC." Id., at 545. Representative Frenzel, a co-sponsor
of the amendment, pictured it as an attempt to alter the
result in the Northern States case. The AEC, he
explained, could not be expected to protect the health
and safety of the public as effectively as the States,
because "the AEC has a dual mission—that of promotion
as well as safety." 1 Leg. Hist. 548.15
The opponents of the Wolff Amendment voiced strong
opposition to the transfer of the AEC'S regulatory
authority to the States or to the EPA. Representative
Stanton, a Member of the House Committee on Public
Works, which reported the House bill, stated:
"The amendment presents the House with a very complex and
difficult proposition. It proposes to take authority for the setting of
pollution control standards from the AEC and places it in the hands
of EPA. For normal operations involving pollution, that control
properly belongs under EPA. But atomic energy is a peculiar field.
To date, the operation of the atomic energy program has been
under the control of the Commission itself. Eventually, such
control will be delegated to the States as more and more
knowledgeable people at the State level become [426 U.S. 19]
involved in the atomic energy program. That time, however, has
not yet arrived. Until we reach that stage it is obvious that the
control of which we speak should remain with the Atomic Energy
Commission itself, as the committee points out on page 131 of
House Report 92-911 [quoted supra, at 11], which accompanies this
bill. For this reason, I would oppose the amendment offered by my
distinguished colleague." Id., at 554-555.
Representative Price, Vice Chairman of the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy, argued against the
amendment as follows:
"The bill as reported establishes a program of effluent limitations
and standards, and section 510 clearly provides that the States may
set more restrictive standards should they so desire. The proposed
amendment is aimed at two so-called pollutants— radioactive
materials and thermal discharges—and seeks to collaterally amend
any statute enacted by the Congress relative to them without any
specific reference to the statutes that might be affected. As to
radioactive materials, the target of the amendment is obvious. It
seeks to reverse the decisions of the courts which have held that the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 preempted to the Federal Government,
acting through the Atomic Energy Commission, the exclusive
jurisdiction to regulate most radioactive materials. Clearly, if such is
the will of the House, it should be undertaken only after a through
examination of the impact of such a decision and it should be done
directly by amending the statute involved—the Atomic Energy
Act—not collaterally through this legislation. If this amendment had
been proposed as a piece of original legislation, it would have been
referred to the appropriate [426 U.S. 20] committee for hearings
and evaluation of all the pertinent factors involved in such a
decision. I could go on with the explanation of those factors, but
this is not the time nor the place for such a consideration in the first
instance. This bill is not the appropriate vehicle for amending a
major piece of legislation, thoroughly considered in committee and
by the Congress, which established at the direction of the Congress
a thorough and pervasive regulatory program relative to radioactive
materials." Id., at 556.
Representative McCormack, a Member of the House
Committee on Public Works and Chairman of the
House Science and Astronautics Committee's Task
Force on Energy Research and Development, urged the
amendment's defeat in similar terms. After noting the
inadvisability of "throwing away" the AEC'S "meticulous
work" in the area of safety in favor of state regulation,
id., at 550, he concluded:
"[I]t is obvious from the report by the House Committee on Public
Works for this bill, and from the committee report from the other
body that this bill does not impact directly upon the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954. This bill applies only to radioactive materials not
covered by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and, as such, the
amendment is not relevant to this bill at all." Id., at 551.16
Respondents urge that the Wolff amendment was
addressed only to the question of the States' regulatory
authority, and that its defeat did not reflect any intent to
foreclose regulation of source, byproduct, and special
nuclear materials by the EPA. We do not agree that [426
U.S. 21] the House's consideration of the Wolff
amendment leaves room for EPA regulation. Several of
the opponents of the amendment were quite explicit in
their reliance upon the House Committee Report's
statement that radioactive materials subject to AEA
regulation were excluded from the coverage of the
FWPCA.17 Neither Representative Wolff nor
Representative Frenzel took issue with that
interpretation in the course of the debate on their
amendment,18 and indeed it is arguable that their
amendment was premised on the assumption that
source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials were
wholly beyond the scope of the FWPCA. If these
materials were covered by the Act—that is, if they were
"pollutants"—the amendment was wholly superfluous,
for the unamended provision that is now 33 U. S. C. §
1370 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) would permit the States to
regulate their discharge. But regardless of the underlying
assumptions of the sponsors of the Wolff amendment,
[426 U.S. 22] the interpretation respondents would place
upon its defeat is unacceptable. As respondents would
have it, the House expressed an intent to permit EPA
regulation of the materials in question, but to preclude
state regulation of the same materials under the
FWPCA. That result could find no basis in the language
of the Act. In our view, then, the House's consideration
and rejection of the Wolff amendment offers additional
support for the interpretation stated in the House
Committee Report that source, byproduct, and special
nuclear materials are beyond the reach of the FWPCA.
The House's rather explicit statement of intent to
exclude AEA-regulated materials from the FWPCA was
unchallenged by the Conference Committee, which
simply retained the same reference to "radioactive
materials" contained in both the House and Senate bills.
S. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 144 (1972), 1 Leg. Hist.
327. Representative Harsha, a ranking member of the
Conference Committee, explained the import of the
Conference Committee action as follows:
"The conference report does not change the original intent as it was
made clear in the colloquy between Senators Muskie and Pastore in
the course of the debate in the other body. I also note that an
amendment to H. R. 11896 was offered on March 28, 1972, which
would have overturned the Northern States Power against
Minnesota case.
"The distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Holifield) spoke
in opposition to the amendment and pointed out the necessity of
not changing the careful division of authority between the States
and the Federal Government over nuclear materials and facilities as
enunciated in the Northern States case. The amendment was
defeated by a 3-to-1 vote of the House.
[426 U.S. 23] "I can say to the gentleman from Illinois that the
managers in no way detracted from the intent of the language in H.
R. 11896. I also note that the Committee on Public Works in its
report on H. R. 11896 stated on page 131 that the term `pollutant'
as defined in the bill includes `radioactive materials.' These
materials are not those encompassed in the definition of source,
byproduct, or special nuclear materials as defined by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and regulated pursuant to that act.
`Radioactive materials' encompassed by this bill are those beyond
the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission. Examples of
radioactive materials not covered by the Atomic Energy Act, and,
therefore, included within the term `pollutant' are radium and
accelerator produced isotopes. This language adequately reflects the
intent of the managers of the conference report." Id., at 226-227.
See also id., at 229 (remarks of Rep. Jones). With no one
expressing a different view of the Conference action, the
House proceeded to agree to the Conference Report. Id.,
at 276.19
V
If it was not clear at the outset, we think it abundantly
clear after a review of the legislative materials that
reliance on the "plain meaning" of the words
"radioactive materials" contained in the definition of
"pollutant" in the FWPCA contributes little to our
understanding of [426 U.S. 24] whether Congress
intended the Act to encompass the regulation of source,
byproduct, and special nuclear materials. To have
included these materials under the FWPCA would have
marked a significant alteration of the pervasive
regulatory scheme embodied in the AEA. Far from
containing the clear indication of legislative intent that
we might expect before recognizing such a change in
policy, cf. United States v. United Continental Tuna
Corp., 425 U.S. 164, 168-169 (1976), the legislative
history reflects, on balance, an intention to preserve the
pre-existing regulatory plan.20
[426 U.S. 25] We conclude, therefore, that the
"pollutants" subject to regulation under the FWPCA do
not include source, byproduct, and special nuclear
materials, and that the EPA Administrator has acted in
accordance with his statutory mandate in declining to
regulate the discharge of such materials. The judgment
of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
