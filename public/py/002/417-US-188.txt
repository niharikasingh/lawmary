These cases arise under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77
Stat. 56, § 3, 29 U. S. C. § 206 (d) (1),1 which added to §
6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 the principle
of equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. The
principal question posed is whether Corning Glass
Works violated the Act by paying a higher base wage to
male night shift inspectors than it paid to female
inspectors performing the same tasks on the day shift,
where the higher wage was paid in addition to a separate
night shift differential paid to all employees for night
work. In No. 73-29, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, in a case involving several Corning plants in
Corning, New York, held that this practice violated [417
U.S. 191] the Act. 474 F.2d 226 (1973). In No. 73-695,
the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in a case
involving a Corning plant in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania,
reached the opposite conclusion. 480 F.2d 1254 (1973).
We granted certiorari and consolidated the cases to
resolve this unusually direct conflict between two
circuits. 414 U.S. 1110 (1973). Finding ourselves in
substantial agreement with the analysis of the Second
Circuit, we affirm in No. 73-29 and reverse in No. 73-
695.
I
Prior to 1925, Corning operated its plants in Wellsboro
and Corning only during the day, and all inspection
work was performed by women. Between 1925 and
1930, the company began to introduce automatic
production equipment which made it desirable to
institute a night shift. During this period, however, both
New York and Pennsylvania law prohibited women
from working at night.2 As a result, in order to fill
inspector positions on the new night shift, the company
had to recruit male employees from among its male
dayworkers. The male employees so transferred
demanded and received wages substantially higher than
those paid to women inspectors engaged on the two day
shifts.3 During this same period, however, [417 U.S. 192]
no plant-wide shift differential existed and male
employees working at night, other than inspectors,
received the same wages as their day shift counterparts.
Thus a situation developed where the night inspectors
were all male,4 the day inspectors all female, and the
male inspectors received significantly higher wages.
In 1944, Corning plants at both locations were
organized by a labor union and a collective-bargaining
agreement was negotiated for all production and
maintenance employees. This agreement for the first
time established a plant-wide shift differential,5 but this
change did not eliminate the higher base wage paid to
male night inspectors. Rather, the shift differential was
superimposed on the existing difference in base wages
between male night inspectors and female day
inspectors.
Prior to June 11, 1964, the effective date of the Equal
Pay Act,6 the law in both Pennsylvania and New York
[417 U.S. 193] was amended to permit women to work at
night.7 It was not until some time after the effective date
of the Act, however, that Corning initiated efforts to
eliminate [417 U.S. 194] the differential rates for male
and female inspectors. Beginning in June 1966, Corning
started to open up jobs on the night shift to women.
Previously separate male and female seniority lists were
consolidated and women became eligible to exercise
their seniority, on the same basis as men, to bid for the
higher paid night inspection jobs as vacancies occurred.
On January 20, 1969, a new collective-bargaining
agreement went into effect, establishing a new "job
evaluation" system for setting wage rates. The new
agreement abolished for the future the separate base
wages for day and night shift inspectors and imposed a
uniform base wage for inspectors exceeding the wage
rate for the night shift previously in effect. All
inspectors hired after January 20, 1969, were to receive
the same base wage, whatever their sex or shift. The
collective-bargaining agreement further provided,
however, for a higher "red circle" rate for employees
hired prior to January 20, 1969, when working as
inspectors on the night shift. This "red circle" rate
served essentially to perpetuate the differential in base
wages between day and night inspectors.
The Secretary of Labor brought these cases to enjoin
Corning from violating the Equal Pay Act8 and to collect
back wages allegedly due female employees because of
past violations. Three distinct questions are presented:
[417 U.S. 195] (1) Did Corning ever violate the Equal Pay
Act by paying male night shift inspectors more than
female day shift inspectors? (2) If so, did Corning cure
its violation of the Act in 1966 by permitting women to
work as night shift inspectors? (3) Finally, if the
violation was not remedied in 1966, did Corning cure its
violation in 1969 by equalizing day and night inspector
wage rates but establishing higher "red circle" rates for
existing employees working on the night shift?
II
Congress' purpose in enacting the Equal Pay Act was to
remedy what was perceived to be a serious and endemic
problem of employment discrimination in private
industry —the fact that the wage structure of "many
segments of American industry has been based on an
ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his
role in society, should be paid more than a woman even
though his duties are the same." S. Rep. No. 176, 88th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1963). The solution adopted was
quite simple in principle: to require that "equal work
will be rewarded by equal wages." Ibid.
The Act's basic structure and operation are similarly
straightforward. In order to make out a case under the
Act, the Secretary must show that an employer pays
different wages to employees of opposite sexes "for
equal work on jobs the performance of which requires
equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are
performed under similar working conditions." Although
the Act is silent on this point, its legislative history
makes plain that the Secretary has the burden of proof
on this issue,9 as both of the courts below recognized.10
[417 U.S. 196] The Act also establishes four
exceptions—three specific and one a general catchall
provision—where different payment to employees of
opposite sexes "is made pursuant to (i) a seniority
system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures
earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a
differential based on any other factor other than sex."
Again, while the Act is silent on this question, its
structure and history also suggest that once the
Secretary has carried his burden of showing that the
employer pays workers of one sex more than workers of
the opposite sex for equal work, the burden shifts to the
employer to show that the differential is justified under
one of the Act's four exceptions. All of the many lower
courts that have considered this question have so held,11
and this view is consistent with the general rule that the
application of an exemption under the Fair Labor [417
U.S. 197] Standards Act is a matter of affirmative defense
on which the employer has the burden of proof.12
The contentions of the parties in this case reflect the
Act's underlying framework. Corning argues that the
Secretary has failed to prove that Corning ever violated
the Act because day shift work is not "performed under
similar working conditions" as night shift work. The
Secretary maintains that day shift and night shift work
are performed under "similar working conditions"
within the meaning of the Act.13 Although the Secretary
recognizes that higher wages may be paid for night shift
work, the Secretary contends that such a shift
differential would be based upon a "factor other than
sex" within the catchall exception to the Act and that
Corning has failed to carry its burden of proof that its
higher base wage for male night inspectors was in fact
based on any factor other than sex.
The courts below relied in part on conflicting
statements in the legislative history having some bearing
on [417 U.S. 198] this question of statutory construction.
The Third Circuit found particularly significant a
statement of Congressman Goodell, a sponsor of the
Equal Pay bill, who, in the course of explaining the bill
on the floor of the House, commented that "standing as
opposed to sitting, pleasantness or unpleasantness of
surroundings, periodic rest periods, hours of work,
difference in shift, all would logically fall within the
working condition factor." 109 Cong. Rec. 9209 (1963)
(emphasis added). The Second Circuit, in contrast,
relied on a statement from the House Committee Report
which, in describing the broad general exception for
differentials "based on any other factor other than sex,"
stated: "Thus, among other things, shift differentials . . .
would also be excluded. . . ." H. R. Rep. No. 309, 88th
Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1963).
We agree with Judge Friendly, however, that in this
case a better understanding of the phrase "performed
under similar working conditions" can be obtained from
a consideration of the way in which Congress arrived at
the statutory language than from trying to reconcile or
establish preferences between the conflicting
interpretations of the Act by individual legislators or the
committee reports. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter remarked
in an earlier case involving interpretation of the Fair
Labor Standards Act, "regard for the specific history of
the legislative process that culminated in the Act now
before us affords more solid ground for giving it
appropriate meaning." United States v. Universal C. I. T.
Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 222 (1952).
The most notable feature of the history of the Equal Pay
Act is that Congress recognized early in the legislative
process that the concept of equal pay for equal work was
more readily stated in principle than reduced to
statutory language which would be meaningful to
employers and workable across the broad range of
industries covered [417 U.S. 199] by the Act. As
originally introduced, the Equal Pay bill required equal
pay for "equal work on jobs the performance of which
requires equal skills." There were only two
exceptions—for differentials "made pursuant to a
seniority or merit increase system which does not
discriminate on the basis of sex. . . ."14
In both the House and Senate committee hearings,
witnesses were highly critical of the Act's definition of
equal work and of its exemptions. Many noted that most
of American industry used formal, systematic job
evaluation plans to establish equitable wage structures in
their plants.15 Such systems, as explained coincidentally
by a representative of Corning Glass Works who
testified at both hearings, took into consideration four
separate factors in determining job value—skill, effort,
responsibility and working conditions—and each of
these four components was further systematically
divided into various subcomponents.16 Under a job
evaluation plan, point values are assigned to each of the
subcomponents of a given job, resulting in a total point
figure representing a relatively objective measure of the
job's value.
In comparison to the rather complex job evaluation
plans used by industry, the definition of equal work used
in the first drafts of the Equal Pay bill was criticized as
[417 U.S. 200] unduly vague and incomplete. Industry
representatives feared that as a result of the bill's
definition of equal work, the Secretary of Labor would
be cast in the position of second-guessing the validity of
a company's job evaluation system. They repeatedly
urged that the bill be amended to include an exception
for job classification systems, or otherwise to
incorporate the language of job evaluation into the bill.17
Thus Corning's own representative testified:
"Job evaluation is an accepted and tested method of attaining equity
in wage relationship.
"A great part of industry is committed to job evaluation by past
practice and by contractual agreement as the basis for wage
administration.
" `Skill' alone, as a criterion, fails to recognize other aspects of the
job situation that affect job worth.
"We sincerely hope that this committee in passing legislation to
eliminate wage differences based on sex alone, will recognize in its
language the general role of job evaluation in establishing equitable
rate relationship."18
We think it plain that in amending the bill's definition
of equal work to its present form, the Congress acted in
direct response to these pleas. Spokesmen for the
amended bill stated, for example, during the House
debates:
"The concept of equal pay for jobs demanding equal skill has been
expanded to require also equal effort, responsibility, and similar
working conditions. These factors are the core of all job
classification [417 U.S. 201] systems. They form a legitimate basis
for differentials in pay."19
Indeed, the most telling evidence of congressional intent
is the fact that the Act's amended definition of equal
work incorporated the specific language of the job
evaluation plan described at the hearings by Corning's
own representative —that is, the concepts of "skill,"
"effort," "responsibility," and "working conditions."
Congress' intent, as manifested in this history, was to
use these terms to incorporate into the new federal Act
the well-defined and well-accepted principles of job
evaluation so as to ensure that wage differentials based
upon bona fide job evaluation plans would be outside
the purview of the Act. The House Report emphasized:
"This language recognizes that there are many factors which may be
used to measure the relationships between jobs and which establish
a valid basis for a difference in pay. These factors will be found in a
majority of the job classification systems. Thus, it is anticipated that
a bona fide job classification program that does not discriminate on
the basis of sex will serve as a valid defense to a charge of
discrimination." H. R. Rep. No. 309, supra, at 3.
It is in this light that the phrase "working conditions"
must be understood, for where Congress has used
technical words or terms of art, "it [is] proper to explain
them by reference to the art or science to which they
[are] appropriate." Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U.S. 278,
284 (1880). See also NLRB v. Highland Park Mfg. Co.,
341 U.S. 322, 326 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).
This principle is particularly salutary where, as [417 U.S.
202] here, the legislative history reveals that Congress
incorporated words having a special meaning within the
field regulated by the statute so as to overcome
objections by industry representatives that statutory
definitions were vague and incomplete.
While a layman might well assume that time of day
worked reflects one aspect of a job's "working
conditions," the term has a different and much more
specific meaning in the language of industrial relations.
As Corning's own representative testified at the
hearings, the element of working conditions
encompasses two subfactors: "surroundings" and
"hazards."20 "Surroundings" measures the elements, such
as toxic chemicals or fumes, regularly encountered by a
worker, their intensity, and their frequency. "Hazards"
takes into account the physical hazards regularly
encountered, their frequency, and the severity of injury
they can cause. This definition of "working conditions"
is not only manifested in Corning's own job evaluation
plans but is also well accepted across a wide range of
American industry.21
Nowhere in any of these definitions is time of day
worked mentioned as a relevant criterion. The fact of
the matter is that the concept of "working conditions,"
as used in the specialized language of job evaluation
systems, simply does not encompass shift differentials.
Indeed, while Corning now argues that night inspection
work is not equal to day inspection work, all of its own
job evaluation plans, including the one now in effect,
have consistently treated them as equal in all respects,
[417 U.S. 203] including working conditions.22 And
Corning's Manager of Job Evaluation testified in No. 73-
29 that time of day worked was not considered to be a
"working condition."23 Significantly, it is not the
Secretary in this case who is trying to look behind
Corning's bona fide job evaluation system to require
equal pay for jobs which Corning has historically viewed
as unequal work. Rather, it is Corning which asks us to
differentiate between jobs which the company itself has
always equated. We agree with the Second Circuit that
the inspection work at issue in this case, whether
performed during the day or night, is "equal work" as
that term is defined in the Act.24
[417 U.S. 204] This does not mean, of course, that there
is no room in the Equal Pay Act for nondiscriminatory
shift differentials. Work on a steady night shift no doubt
has psychological and physiological impacts making it
less attractive than work on a day shift. The Act
contemplates that a male night worker may receive a
higher wage than a female day worker, just as it
contemplates that a male employee with 20 years'
seniority can receive a higher wage than a woman with
two years' seniority. Factors such as these play a role
under the Act's four exceptions—the seniority
differential under the specific seniority exception, the
shift differential under the catchall exception for
differentials "based on any other factor other than sex."25
The question remains, however, whether Corning
carried its burden of proving that the higher rate paid
for night inspection work, until 1966 performed solely
by men, was in fact intended to serve as compensation
for night work, or rather constituted an added payment
based upon sex. We agree that the record amply
supports the District Court's conclusion that Corning
had not sustained its burden of proof.26 As its history
revealed, [417 U.S. 205] "the higher night rate was in
large part the product of the generally higher wage level
of male workers and the need to compensate them for
performing what were regarded as demeaning tasks."
474 F. 2d, at 233. The differential in base wages
originated at a time when no other night employees
received higher pay than corresponding day workers,
and it was maintained long after the company instituted
a separate plant-wide shift differential which was
thought to compensate adequately for the additional
burdens of night work. The differential arose simply
because men would not work at the low rates paid
women inspectors, and it reflected a job market in
which Corning could pay women less than men for the
same work. That the company took advantage of such a
situation may be understandable as a matter of
economics, but its differential nevertheless became
illegal once Congress enacted into law the principle of
equal pay for equal work.
III
We now must consider whether Corning continued to
remain in violation of the Act after 1966 when, without
changing the base wage rates for day and night
inspectors, it began to permit women to bid for jobs on
the night shift as vacancies occurred. It is evident that
this was more than a token gesture to end
discrimination, as turnover in the night shift inspection
jobs was rapid. The record in No. 73-29 shows, for
example, that during the two-year period after June 1,
1966, the date women were first permitted to bid for
night inspection jobs, women took 152 of the 278
openings, and women with very little seniority were
able to obtain positions on the night shift. [417 U.S. 206]
Relying on these facts, the company argues that it ceased
discriminating against women in 1966, and was no
longer in violation of the Equal Pay Act.
But the issue before us is not whether the company, in
some abstract sense, can be said to have treated men the
same as women after 1966. Rather, the question is
whether the company remedied the specific violation of
the Act which the Secretary proved. We agree with the
Second Circuit, as well as with all other circuits that
have had occasion to consider this issue, that the
company could not cure its violation except by
equalizing the base wages of female day inspectors with
the higher rates paid the night inspectors. This result is
implicit in the Act's language, its statement of purpose,
and its legislative history.
As the Second Circuit noted, Congress enacted the
Equal Pay Act "[r]ecognizing the weaker bargaining
position of many women and believing that
discrimination in wage rates represented unfair
employer exploitation of this source of cheap labor." 474
F. 2d, at 234. In response to evidence of the many
families dependent on the income of working women,
Congress included in the Act's statement of purpose a
finding that "the existence. . . of wage differentials based
on sex . . . depresses wages and living standards for
employees necessary for their health and efficiency."
Pub. L. 88-38, § 2 (a) (1), 77 Stat. 56 (1963). And
Congress declared it to be the policy of the Act to
correct this condition. § 2 (b).
To achieve this end, Congress required that employers
pay equal pay for equal work and then specified:
"Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential
in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the
provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any
employee." 29 U. S. C. § 206 (d) (1).
[417 U.S. 207] The purpose of this proviso was to ensure
that to remedy violations of the Act, "[t]he lower wage
rate must be increased to the level of the higher." H. R.
Rep. No. 309, supra, at 3. Comments of individual
legislators are all consistent with this view.
Representative Dwyer remarked, for example, "The
objective of equal pay legislation. . . is not to drag down
men workers to the wage levels of women, but to raise
women to the levels enjoyed by men in cases where
discrimination is still practiced."27 Representative
Griffin also thought it clear that "[t]he only way a
violation could be remedied under the bill . . . is for the
lower wages to be raised to the higher."28
By proving that after the effective date of the Equal Pay
Act, Corning paid female day inspectors less than male
night inspectors for equal work, the Secretary implicitly
demonstrated that the wages of female day shift
inspectors were unlawfully depressed and that the fair
wage for inspection work was the base wage paid to
male inspectors on the night shift. The whole purpose
of the Act was to require that these depressed wages be
raised, in part as a matter of simple justice to the
employees themselves, but also as a matter of market
economics, since Congress recognized as well that
discrimination in wages on the basis of sex "constitutes
an unfair method of competition." Pub. L. 88-38, supra,
§ 2 (a) (5).
We agree with Judge Friendly that
"In light of this apparent congressional understanding, we cannot
hold that Corning, by allowing some—or even many—women to
move into the higher paid night jobs, achieved full compliance with
the Act. Corning's action still left the inspectors on the day
shift—virtually all women—earning a lower [417 U.S. 208] base
wage than the night shift inspectors because of a differential
initially based on sex and still not justified by any other
consideration; in effect, Corning was still taking advantage of the
availability of female labor to fill its day shift at a differentially low
wage rate not justified by any factor other than sex." 474 F. 2d, at
235.
The Equal Pay Act is broadly remedial, and it should be
construed and applied so as to fulfill the underlying
purposes which Congress sought to achieve. If, as the
Secretary proved, the work performed by women on the
day shift was equal to that performed by men on the
night shift, the company became obligated to pay the
women the same base wage as their male counterparts
on the effective date of the Act. To permit the company
to escape that obligation by agreeing to allow some
women to work on the night shift at a higher rate of pay
as vacancies occurred would frustrate, not serve,
Congress' ends. See Shultz v. American Can Co.-Dixie
Products, 424 F.2d 356, 359 (CA8 1970); Hodgson v.
Miller Brewing Co., 457 F.2d 221, 227 (CA7 1972);
Hodgson v. Square D Co., 459 F.2d 805, 808-809 (CA6
1972).
The company's final contention—that it cured its
violation of the Act when a new collective-bargaining
agreement went into effect on January 20, 1969—need
not detain us long. While the new agreement provided
for equal base wages for night or day inspectors hired
after that date, it continued to provide unequal base
wages for employees hired before that date, a
discrimination likely to continue for some time into the
future because of a large number of laid-off employees
who had to be offered re-employment before new
inspectors could be hired. After considering the rather
complex method in which the new wage rates for
employees hired prior to January 1969 were calculated
and the company's stated purpose [417 U.S. 209] behind
the provisions of the new agreement, the District Court
in No. 73-29 concluded that the lower base wage for day
inspectors was a direct product of the company's failure
to equalize the base wages for male and female
inspectors as of the effective date of the Act. We agree it
is clear from the record that had the company equalized
the base-wage rates of male and female inspectors on the
effective date of the Act, as the law required, the day
inspectors in 1969 would have been entitled to the same
higher "red circle" rate the company provided for night
inspectors.29 We therefore conclude that on the facts of
this case, the company's continued discrimination in
base wages between night and day workers, though
phrased in terms of a neutral factor other than sex,
nevertheless operated to perpetuate the effects of the
company's prior illegal practice of paying women less
[417 U.S. 210] than men for equal work. Cf. Griggs v.
Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430 (1971).
The judgment in No. 73-29 is affirmed. The judgment in
No. 73-695 is reversed and the case remanded to the
Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
