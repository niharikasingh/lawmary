I concur in the judgment of the majority. I write
separately because of my reluctance to join what, with
all due respect, I view as an unnecessary excursion into
areas of legislative motive and functioning.
As the arbitrator and the district court found, the plain
meaning of the term "substantially all" used in 29 U.S.C.
ยง 1381 favors the Pension Fund. While what
"substantially all" means in numerical terms may not be
clear, what is clear is that it does not mean a bare
majority. In light of the plain meaning of the statute as it
relates to the question posed in this case, it is
questionable whether examination of the legislative
history of the statute is appropriate, much less
enlightening. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of the
Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 1503 n. 3, 103
L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) ("Legislative history is irrelevant to
the interpretation of an unambiguous statute.").
Moreover, any impact of the scant legislative history of
ยง 1381 on the decision of this case is at best neutral.
Continental's case is based in part on a particularly
disfavored form of legislative "history," post-enactment
statements. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. at 566-
68, 108 S.Ct. at 2550 (1988); United States v. United
Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 281-82, 67 S.Ct. 677, 690,
91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d
1312, 1318-19 (7th Cir.1990) (en banc). Even the preenactment
statement of Senator Durenberger on which
Continental relies conflicts with a contemporaneous
statement made by Representative Thompson, to which
we must accord equal weight.
Furthermore, the interpretation the arbitrator gave the
term "substantially all" is consistent with the use of that
term by the Internal Revenue Service in a variety of
contexts. Turning to judicial interpretations, the view
Continental propounds is inconsistent with the one
taken by two [916 F.2d 1161] district courts in this
Circuit. Central States Pension Fund v. Bellmont
Trucking Co., 610 F.Supp. 1505, 1510-11
(N.D.Ind.1985), aff'd on other grounds, 788 F.2d 428
(7th Cir.1986); Peick v. PBGC, 539 F.Supp. 1025, 1060-
61 (N.D.Ill.1982), aff'd on other grounds, 724 F.2d 1247
(7th Cir.1983). These reasons, taken together, suffice to
dispose of this case.
