I respectfully dissent. Applying the usual mode of
analysis used in this circuit for determining whether a
statute allows assignment of claims, I would conclude
that Nancey Silvers, as the original creator [402 F.3d
891] of "The Other Woman," should be allowed to
pursue the accrued causes of action that Frank & Bob
Films II assigned to her.
Section 501(b) of the 1976 Copyright Act establishes the
standing requirement for infringement actions:
The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a
copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411, to
institute an action for any infringement of that particular right
committed while he or she is the owner of it.
17 U.S.C. § 501(b). The majority relies on the notion
that "[t]he meaning of that provision appears clear,"
ante at 884, to conclude that the assignment to Silvers is
invalid because she does not own an exclusive right
under the copyright. Ante at 890.
The majority opinion, however, is internally
inconsistent, provides inadequate support for its
conclusion, and ignores our analogous precedents.
1. The inconsistency turns on the majority's citation of §
501(b)'s durational limitation, i.e., that the owner is not
entitled to sue unless the alleged infringement occurred
"while he or she [was] the owner of [the copyright
right]," as evidence of Congress's tight circumscription
of persons who have standing to sue. Ante at 885-86.
The majority maintains that "Congress' explicit listing of
who may sue for copyright infringement should be
understood as an exclusion of others from suing for
infringement." Ante at 885.
As the majority later acknowledges, however, the
durational limitation is hardly airtight. After a copyright
holder sells a copyright, in whole or in part, the new
owner may pursue a cause of action that accrued before
purchase, as long as the cause of action is transferred
along with the copyright. Ante at 890, fn. 1. The
majority maintains that this "makes perfect sense,"
because "[w]hen one acquires a copyright that has been
infringed, one is acquiring a copyright whose value has
been impaired," and "[c]onsequently, to receive
maximum value for the impaired copyright, one must
also convey the right to recover the value of the
impairment by instituting a copyright action." Ante at
890, fn. 1.
However practical this analysis, the fact remains that it
cannot be squared with a literal reading of section
501(b), on which the majority otherwise rests. And, as
the language of section 501(b) is not necessarily
determinative in deciding the viability of assignments of
accrued rights to sue for copyright infringement, section
501(b) cannot, absent further analysis, dictate the
majority's conclusion that no assignment of accrued
causes of action without transfer of the underlying
copyright is permissible.
2. If the language of § 501(b) is not determinative, then
what is? I agree with Judge Bea that the assumption that
background common law principles apply with regard
to assignment of accrued causes of action applies to the
Copyright Act as to other federal statutes. Post at 901-
03. I part company with Judge Bea, however, at the
point at which he suggests that an entirely free market
for accrued causes of action in copyright is the proper
antidote to the majority's preclusion of effective transfer
of such accrued causes of action. Post at 905. Instead, I
would hold that Silvers, given her status as the original
creator of the contested "work-for-hire," may pursue the
accrued claims assigned by Frank & Bob Films, while a
complete stranger to the creative process could not.
Contrary to the majority's strict statutory approach, the
question of valid assignment "is appropriate for the
development [402 F.3d 892] of interstitial federal
common law [to ensure] harmony with the overall
purposes of the [Copyright Act]." Gulfstream III Assocs.
v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 438 (3d
Cir.1993). Our circuit's precedents support approach to
the general question of whether claims created by
federal statute are assignable. In particular, this circuit's
cases deciding whether to enforce assignments of
Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA")
claims, which focus on whether "the general goal of the
statute would be served by prohibiting the type of
assignments involved in th[e] case," Misic v. Bldg. Serv.
Employees Health & Welfare Trust, 789 F.2d 1374, 1377
(9th Cir.1986) (per curiam), provide a helpful analog for
consideration of Silvers' case.
Misic decided that a health care provider, assigned
accrued causes of action for health welfare benefits by
his patients, could pursue his ERISA lawsuit. Our
analysis proceeded in two steps. First, we reviewed the
statutory text to decide whether ERISA permitted
assignment of the claims for reimbursement of welfare
benefits. Id. at 1376-77. The statute specifically
precludes assignment or alienation of pension benefits,
but is silent as to assignment of welfare benefits.1 We
interpreted ERISA's silence on assignment in the
welfare benefit plan context, in light of the explicit antiassignment
provision for pension claims, to allow
assignment of welfare claims, because "[n]either the
specific purpose of the anti-assignment provision nor
the general goal of the statute would be served by
prohibiting the type of assignment involved in [the]
case." Id. at 1377 (emphases added).
Second, we decided that the assignee, Misic, had
standing to sue, even though the statutory provision
authorizing suit identified only "participants,
beneficiaries, fiduciaries, and the Secretary of Labor" as
the parties with standing bring suit.2 Id. at 1378 (citing
29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)). Unlike the majority in this case, we
did not consider the statutory language determinative
on the question of assignability of accrued causes of
action. Instead, we looked to the relevant statute to
determine whether the assignors had standing, not to
decide whether to honor the assignment. We concluded
that the assignment was permissible because "Dr. Misic
`st[ood] in the shoes of the [b]eneficiaries;' and Dr.
Misic's assignors, beneficiaries under the Act [were]
expressly authorized by[the statute] to sue to recover
benefits due under a plan." Id. (emphasis added, second
alteration in original).
We took the same general approach, albeit with the
opposite result, in Simon v. Value Behavioral Health,
Inc., 208 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2000). Although we read
Misic to allow assignment to healthcare providers, we
refused in Simon to honor the assignment of claims
from "health care providers to whom the beneficiaries
originally [402 F.3d 893] assigned their claims." Id. at
1081. Simon explains that in Misic,
we granted derivative standing to health care providers not because
we believed that federal common law on derivative standing
trumps the plain language of [the statute]. We granted it because
permitting health care providers to sue in place of the beneficiaries
they had treated was consistent with Congressional intent in
enacting ERISA.
Id. Our decision to disallow assignment of claims by
health care providers was related to underlying public
policy concerns, as "grant[ing] Simon standing
would[have] be[en] tantamount to transforming health
benefit claims into a freely tradable commodity." Id.
Predicting that the opposite result "would allow third
parties with no relationship to the beneficiary to acquire
claims solely for the purpose of litigating them," we
declined to recognize the assignment as it was unclear
"how such a result would further ERISA's purpose." Id.
Both this circuit and others have used similar policybased
analyses in deciding whether assignments of other
federal statutory claims were valid. See, e.g., Simon, 208
F.3d at 1082-83 (antitrust claim under the Clayton act);
Klamath Lake Pharm. Ass'n v. Klamath Med. Serv.
Bureau, 701 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir.1983) (considering the
background rule that only a real party in interest may
prosecute claims in federal court to hold that an
assignment was valid); Pac. Coast Agric. Export Ass'n v.
Sunkist Growers, Inc., 526 F.2d 1196 (9th Cir.1975); see
also Tex. Life, Accident, Health & Hosp. Serv. Ins. Guar.
Ass'n v. Gaylord Entm't Group, 105 F.3d 210, 215 (5th
Cir.1997) (using Misic's approach to consider whether
"derivative standing to assignees of breach of fiduciary
duty claims ... [would] frustrate ERISA's purpose"). I
would do so here as well.
3. I turn, therefore, to whether Frank & Bob Films'
assignment of the accrued cause of action to Silvers, the
original creator of "The Other Woman," should be
permitted under 17 U.S.C. § 501(b).
As the majority makes clear, Silvers is not the owner of
the copyright and therefore would not ordinarily be
permitted to pursue a copyright infringement claim.
Following our approach in the ERISA cases discussed
above, the relevant inquiry is whether recognition of the
assignment to Silvers is consistent with Congress'
overall intent in enacting the 1976 Copyright Act.
The basic purpose of copyright is "to promote the
creation and publication of free expression." Eldred v.
Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 219, 123 S.Ct. 769, 154 L.Ed.2d
683 (2003). Congress has struck "a difficult balance
between the interests of authors and inventors in the
control and exploitation of their writings and
discoveries on the one hand, and society's competing
interest in the free flow of ideas, information, and
commerce on the other hand." Sony Corp. v. Universal
City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 429, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78
L.Ed.2d 574 (1984). To achieve that balance, embedded
in "the traditional contours of copyright protection,"
Eldred, 537 U.S. at 221, 123 S.Ct. 769, are two major
First Amendment protections: (1) as "between ideas and
expression ... only the latter [is] eligible for copyright
protection," id. at 219, 123 S.Ct. 769; and (2) "the `fair
use' defense allows the public to use not only facts and
ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also
expression itself in certain circumstances." Id. (citing 17
U.S.C. § 107).
I see nothing in the assignment of accrued claims of
Frank & Bob Films for infringement of a work created
by Silvers to Silvers that violates these background
principles. Silvers has a significant interest [402 F.3d
894] in the infringement of "The Other Woman," as she
was the original creator. She might well herself have
held the copyright had she not contracted with Frank &
Bob Films to create a work-for-hire. Although she
relinquished the right to the copyright through her
contract with Frank & Bob Films, she maintained an
interest in how her work was used. More importantly,
Silvers, as the creator, is the person for whom the
copyright system is designed to provide incentives for
more creations.
In addition, allowing this assignment is consistent with
"the need for free alienability and divisibility" of
copyright. Gardner v. Nike, Inc., 279 F.3d 774, 781 (9th
Cir.2002). It also conforms with "the necessity [of]
preserv[ing] the rights and control of ... owners and
creators." Id.
Supporting this result is the consideration, discussed
above, that section 501(b)'s limitations have not been
and should not be read as narrowly as possible. As
noted, the majority makes clear that allowing a
copyright owner to pursue claims that accrued before he
held the copyright, once assigned along with the
copyright, is eminently sensible. Ante at 890, fn. 1. I see
no reason why allowing assignment to original creators
of copyrighted works without the copyright would any
more undermine the delicate balance that Congress has
struck. Moreover, as Judge Bea notes, post at 900-01,
Congress is perfectly capable of including antiassignment
provisions in federal statutory schemes, but
declined to so in the 1976 Act.
I would hold, therefore, that Frank & Bob Films, for
whom Silvers completed her work-for-hire, may assign
its accrued causes of action related to that work-for-hire
to Silvers.
4. The majority places significant weight on Crown Die
& Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U.S. 24,
43 S.Ct. 254, 67 L.Ed. 516 (1923), dealing with a
somewhat similar question under patent law. The
differences between copyright and patent law, and
between the nature of the assignment in Crown Die and
this case, are significant enough to warrant a different
result.
In general, "patents and copyrights do not entail the
same exchange." Eldred, 537 U.S. at 216, 123 S.Ct. 769.
"The disclosure required by the Patent Act is `the quid
pro quo of the right to exclude.'" J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc.
v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int'l, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 142, 122
S.Ct. 593, 151 L.Ed.2d 508 (2001) (quoting Kewanee Oil
Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 484, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40
L.Ed.2d 315 (1974)). "For the author seeking copyright
protection, in contrast, disclosure is the desired
objective, not something exacted from the author in
exchange for the copyright." Eldred, 537 U.S. at 216-17,
123 S.Ct. 769.
These distinctions are reflected in the rules governing
suits for infringements of copyrights and patents.
Patentees, for example, "should be joined, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, in any infringement suit
brought by an exclusive licensee." Prima Tek II, L.L.C.
v. A-Roo Co., 222 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2000)
(emphasis added). This scheme differs markedly from
that of copyright infringement suits, as a copyright
holder may transfer the "`exclusive' rights to use and to
authorize the use of his work in five qualified ways."3
Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 433, 104 S.Ct. 774 (citing 17
U.S.C. § 106). Once he does so, "[t]he [402 F.3d 895]
owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled, to the
extent of that right, to all of the protection and remedies
accorded to the copyright owner." 17 U.S.C. § 201(d)(2).
With these differences in mind, I do not find the
majority's reliance on Crown Die, 261 U.S. 24, 43 S.Ct.
254 (1923), persuasive in the current circumstances. The
majority states that "Crown Die effectively creates a
presumption that, when we consider standing under a
statutory scheme involving intellectual property,
common law doctrine does not apply." Ante at 889-90. I
find no support for such a broad statement, given the
significant changes to copyright law since Crown Die
was decided. Issuance of a copyright no longer "vest[s]
an exclusive right in an author," Wheaton v. Peters, 33
U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 663, 8 L.Ed. 1055 (1834) (emphasis
added), but several exclusive rights that the copyright
holder may then divide infinitely. Furthermore, unlike
an inventor who holds a patent, the original copyright
holder need not remain involved in every infringement
action brought under a copyright.
In addition, and critically, Crown Die dealt with a very
different factual scenario than the one we have here.
Reed Manufacturing, the patentee of a screw-thread
cutting device invented by Wright and Hubbard,
assigned its infringement claims against Crown Die &
Tool Company to Nye Tool & Machine Works, a
competitor of Crown Die. Crown Die, 261 U.S. at 25-
26, 43 S.Ct. 254. The assignment would have been
analogous to the one before us if Reed had assigned its
claims to Wright and Hubbard, rather than to a
competitor of Crown Die. Crown Die did not,
therefore, decide the precise question we have before us.
A different result in Crown Die would not only have
created significant tension with the nature of the
monopoly that a patentee holds, but it would have made
an accrued cause of action a commodity on an open
market, permitting assignees without connection to the
patented invention to pursue infringement claims, "with
the sole motive of harassing [infringers]." Id at 39, 43
S.Ct. 254. That Nye and Crown Die were competitors
could only have reinforced this concern.
The 1976 Act ushered in a new era of copyright law,
while leaving in place the general principal goal of
copyright: "to promote the creation and publication of
free expression." Eldred, 537 U.S. at 219, 123 S.Ct. 769. I
find no reason why Frank & Bob's Films' assignment of
accrued claims against Sony to Nancey Silvers does not
comport with that goal. I respectfully dissent.
