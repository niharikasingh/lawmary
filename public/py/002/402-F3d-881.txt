May an assignee who holds an accrued claim for
copyright infringement, but who has no legal or
beneficial interest in the copyright itself, institute an
action for infringement? After analyzing the 1976
Copyright Act and its history, as well as the scant,
although persuasive, precedent that is available in
analogous situations, we answer that question "no."
Accordingly, we reverse the ruling of the district court,
which allowed this action by the assignee to proceed.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL
BACKGROUND
Nancey Silvers wrote the script of a made-for-television
movie called "The Other Woman." Although Silvers
wrote "The Other Woman" script, she did not hold the
copyright, because "The Other Woman" was a workfor-hire
that Silvers completed for Frank & Bob Films II,
aka Von Zerneck/Sertner Films ("Frank & Bob Films").
Frank & Bob Films was the original owner of the
copyright to "The Other Woman," and remains so
today.
About three years after "The Other Woman" aired on a
broadcast network, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc.,
released the motion picture "Stepmom." After the
release of "Stepmom," Frank & Bob Films executed an
"Assignment of Claims and Causes of Action" in favor of
Silvers. Frank & Bob Films retained ownership of the
underlying copyright to "The Other Woman" script, but
assigned to Silvers "all right, title and interest in and to
any claims and causes of action against Sony Pictures
Entertainment, Inc., Columbia TriStar, and any other
appropriate persons or entities, with respect to the
screenplay `The Other Woman' ... and the motion
picture `Stepmom.'"
Silvers then filed a complaint against Sony for copyright
infringement, alleging that the movie "Stepmom" was
substantially similar to the script for "The Other
Woman." Sony moved to dismiss on the ground that
Silvers lacked standing to bring an action for copyright
infringement in the absence of some legal or beneficial
ownership in the underlying copyright. The district
court denied the motion and certified the issue for
interlocutory appeal. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) (providing
procedure).
A panel of this court affirmed the district court's
decision. Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entm't, Inc., 330 F.3d
1204 (9th Cir.2003). The court then voted to take this
case en banc, 370 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir.2004), withdrawing
that opinion.

DISCUSSION
A. The Statute
Article I, section 8, clause 8, of the Constitution states:
"The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for
limited Times to Authors ... the exclusive Right to their
... Writings...." As is clear from its text, that clause of the
Constitution grants no substantive protections to
authors. Rather, Congress is empowered to provide
copyright protection.
Copyright, therefore, is a creature of statute, and the
only rights that exist under copyright law are those
granted by [402 F.3d 884] statute. As the Supreme Court
wrote 170 years ago:
This right [in copyright] ... does not exist at common law-it
originated, if at all, under the acts of congress. No one can deny that
when the legislature are about to vest an exclusive right in an
author or an inventor, they have the power to prescribe the
conditions on which such right shall be enjoyed....
Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 663-64, 8 L.Ed.
1055 (1834); see also Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207,
251, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (stating that copyright is statutorily created);
M. Kramer Mfg. Co. v. Andrews, 783 F.2d 421, 432 (4th
Cir.1986) ("The right of copyright is a creature of
federal statute, with its constitutional base in Article I, §
8, cl. 8."); Russell v. Price, 612 F.2d 1123, 1129 n. 17 (9th
Cir.1979) ("Common-law copyright is no longer
recognized under the [1976] Act...."); Microsoft Corp. v.
Grey Computer, 910 F.Supp. 1077, 1084 (D.Md.1995)
("Unlike contracts, copyrights and the rights flowing
therefrom are entirely creatures of statute....").
Accordingly, our starting point is the statute.
Section 501(b) of the 1976 Copyright Act establishes
who is legally authorized to sue for infringement of a
copyright:
The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a
copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411, to
institute an action for any infringement of that particular right
committed while he or she is the owner of it.
17 U.S.C. § 501(b) (emphasis added). The meaning of
that provision appears clear. To be entitled to sue for
copyright infringement, the plaintiff must be the "legal
or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a
copyright." See 4 Business and Commercial Litigation in
Federal Courts, at 1062, § 65.3(a)(4) (Robert L. Haig ed.)
(West Group & ABA 1998) ("If a claimant is not a
proper owner of copyright rights, then it cannot invoke
copyright protection stemming from the exclusive rights
belonging to the owner, including infringement of the
copyright.").
Section 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act, in turn, defines
"exclusive rights":
(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;
(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;
(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to
the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease,
or lending;
(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual
works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;
(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works,
including the individual images of a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and
(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted
work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.
17 U.S.C. § 106. The right to sue for an accrued claim
for infringement is not an exclusive right under § 106.
Section 201(d) refers to exclusive rights and provides:
(1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in
part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may
be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable
laws of intestate succession.
(2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, including
any subdivision [402 F.3d 885] of any of the rights specified by
section 106, may be transferred as provided by clause (1) and owned
separately. The owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled,
to the extent of that right, to all of the protection and remedies
accorded to the copyright owner by this title.
17 U.S.C. § 201(d). Exclusive rights in a copyright may
be transferred and owned separately, but § 201(d)
creates no exclusive rights other than those listed in §
106, nor does it create an exception to § 501(b).
Section 501(b) must also be read in conjunction with §
501(a), which provides that one who "violates any of the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by
sections 106 through 122 ... is an infringer." The
definition of an infringer in subsection (a) is parallel to
the definition of a proper plaintiff in subsection (b).
Common to both subsections is an exclusive copyright
interest.
In addition, when a copyright interest is transferred it
must be recorded to protect the copyright holder's right
to bring an infringement suit. 17 U.S.C. § 205(d); see
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 129 (1976), reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5744 ("The provisions of subsection
(d)[ ] requir[e] recordation of transfers as a prerequisite
to the institution of an infringement suit...."). This
requirement ensures that prospective buyers or
transferees have notice of the copyright interests owned
by others. See H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 128, reprinted
in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5744 (stating that a copyright
recorded in compliance with subsection (c) provides
constructive notice of its contents). By contrast, the
recording statute does not contemplate a transfer of
anything other than an ownership interest in the
copyright, along with the concomitant exclusive rights.
Returning to the operative section, under § 501(b) the
plaintiff must have a legal or beneficial interest in at
least one of the exclusive rights described in § 106.
Additionally, in order for a plaintiff to be "entitled ... to
institute an action" for infringement, the infringement
must be "committed while he or she is the owner of" the
particular exclusive right allegedly infringed. 17 U.S.C. §
501(b).
The statute does not say expressly that only a legal or
beneficial owner of an exclusive right is entitled to sue.
But, under traditional principles of statutory
interpretation, Congress' explicit listing of who may sue
for copyright infringement should be understood as an
exclusion of others from suing for infringement. The
doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius"as
applied to statutory interpretation creates a
presumption that when a statute designates certain
persons, things, or manners of operation, all omissions
should be understood as exclusions." Boudette v.
Barnette, 923 F.2d 754, 756-57 (9th Cir.1991).
There are two particularly important reasons to apply
such a presumption here. First, we are mindful of the
principle with which we began our discussion:
Copyright is a creature of statute, so we will not lightly
insert common law principles that Congress has left out.
Second, the durational limitation in § 501(b) shows that
Congress restricted even the legal or beneficial owner of
a copyright; the owner is not entitled to sue unless the
alleged infringement occurred "while he or she [was]
the owner of it." In other words, Congress' grant of the
right to sue was carefully circumscribed.
We think the meaning of § 501(b) is clear, but we
recognize that its omission explicitly to address the
present question may create an ambiguity. Therefore,
we consult legislative history. See United States v. Daas,
198 F.3d 1167, 1174 (9th Cir.1999) [402 F.3d 886] ("The
first step in ascertaining congressional intent is to look
to the plain language of the statute.... If the statute is
ambiguous ... courts may look to its legislative history
for evidence of congressional intent.").
B. Legislative History
The 1976 Copyright Act was the result of 15 years of
drafting, deliberations, and compromise. See H.R.Rep.
No. 94-1476. The House Report suggests strongly that
Congress intended to limit the class of persons who may
sue for infringement:
Subsection (b) of section 501 enables the owner of a particular right
to bring an infringement action in that owner's name alone, while
at the same time insuring to the extent possible that the other
owners whose rights may be affected are notified and given a
chance to join the action.
The first sentence of subsection (b) empowers the "legal or
beneficial owner of an exclusive right" to bring suit for "any
infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is
the owner of it." A "beneficial owner" for this purpose would
include, for example, an author who had parted with legal title to
the copyright in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales or
license fees.
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 159, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5775 (emphasis added). Non-owners
claiming a bare right to sue, such as Silvers, are not
entitled to notice or joinder, which suggests that
Congress did not envision their existence, or that the
right to sue was a right severable from ownership of one
of the authorized exclusive rights.
In other words, Congress wanted to ensure that an
owner of any exclusive right in the copyright was
entitled to bring a suit for infringement. Congress
foresaw a permissible division of exclusive rights; the
owner of any one of those exclusive rights may sue, with
other owners being entitled to notice and joinder. In
this sense, Congress intended to "unbundle" the
exclusive rights.
Under the 1909 Copyright Act, which was the
predecessor of the Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright
"proprietor" was the only individual who had standing
to sue for an infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 101(b) (1952);
Gardner v. Nike, Inc., 279 F.3d 774, 777-78 (9th
Cir.2002). Courts interpreted the 1909 statute as
providing a proprietor with an indivisible bundle of
rights arising from a copyright — rights that could not
be assigned piecemeal. Id. at 778. This enforced unity of
rights created serious hardships for copyright holders
who were interested in assigning the various property
rights arising from a copyright separately, for instance
selling the motion picture rights in a novel separately
from the right to print the novel in book form. See
Roger D. Blair & Thomas F. Cotter, The Elusive Logic
of Standing Doctrine in Intellectual Property Law, 74
Tul. L.Rev. 1323, 1366-67 (2000) (discussing history).
Congress, aware of these constraints on commercial
dealings, largely dispensed with the doctrine of
indivisibility in the Copyright Act of 1976. Id.; see also
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 123, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5738-39 (noting that the right to assign
separate property interests in a copyright had "long been
sought by authors and their representatives" and had
"attracted wide support from other groups"). Although
Congress allowed for divisibility of ownership interests
under a copyright, it did not alter the requirement that
only owners of an exclusive right in the copyright could
bring suit.
The legislative history makes clear, too, that the list of
exclusive rights found in [402 F.3d 887] § 106 is
exhaustive. The House Report states:
The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner under section
106 are "to do and to authorize" any of the activities specified in the
five numbered clauses.
H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 61, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5674. If a right is not "specified," then it
is not one of the exclusive rights granted by Congress.
The House Report that deals with the exclusive rights
provided in § 106 also explains that "[e]ach of the five
enumerated rights may be subdivided indefinitely and, ...
in connection with section 201 [governing transfer of
rights], each subdivision of an exclusive right may be
owned and enforced separately." Id. (emphasis added).
In other words, exclusive rights may be chopped up and
owned separately, and each separate owner of a
subdivided exclusive right may sue to enforce that
owned portion of an exclusive right, no matter how
small. For instance, A may own the copyright in a book,
while B may own the right to develop the book into a
screenplay. A may sue an infringer of the book; B may
sue an infringer of the screenplay. But only owners of an
exclusive right in a copyright may sue. For instance,
neither A nor B in the example above could assign an
accrued claim for copyright infringement to C if C had
no legal or beneficial interest in the copyright.
C. Patent Law
We have long noted the strong connection between
copyright and patent law: "Where precedent in
copyright cases is lacking, it is appropriate to look for
guidance to patent law `because of the historic kinship
between patent law and copyright law.'" Harris v. Emus
Records Corp., 734 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1984)
(quoting Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios,
464 U.S. 417, 439, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984));
see also Gardner, 279 F.3d at 780-81 (relying in part on
patent law to hold that rights under an exclusive
copyright license could not be assigned without the
original licensor's consent and holding that assignee
lacked standing to sue). Although the Supreme Court
has not addressed the issue at hand, it has addressed the
question whether a bare assignment can give rise to a
cause of action in the context of patent law.
The Patent Act of 1952 provides that "[a] patentee shall
have remedy by civil action for infringement of his
patent." 35 U.S.C. § 281 (1988). Like the 1976 Copyright
Act, the Patent Act does not explicitly forbid an
assignment of causes of action separate from an
assignment of substantive rights in the protected work.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has interpreted the
Patent Act to provide that only a holder of patent rights
may sue.
In Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine
Works, 261 U.S. 24, 26, 33-35, 43 S.Ct. 254, 67 L.Ed.
516 (1923), the Supreme Court considered whether a
patent holder could assign its claims for infringement to
another party without also transferring rights in the
patent. Like the 1976 Copyright Act, the Patent Act that
was in force at the time the Supreme Court decided
Crown Die did not explicitly forbid the assignment of
bare causes of action for infringement:
Every patent or any interest therein shall be assignable in law by an
instrument in writing, and the patentee or his assigns or legal
representatives may in like manner grant and convey an exclusive
right under his patent to the whole or any specified part of the
United States.
Pub.L. No. 147, § 6, 42 Stat. 389, 391 (1922) (amending
R.S. § 4849). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that
a bare [402 F.3d 888] assignment cannot give rise to a
cause of action for infringement. The Court expressed
its holding in durational terms that echo 17 U.S.C. §
501(b): "If the owner of the patent when the
infringements took place has assigned his patent to one,
and his claims for damages for infringement to another,
then the latter cannot sue at law at all but must compel
his assignor of the claims to sue for him." Id. at 44, 43
S.Ct. 254. The Court reasoned:
"The [patent] monopoly did not exist at common law, and the
rights, therefore, which may be exercised under it cannot be
regulated by the rules of the common law. It is created by the act of
Congress; and no rights can be acquired in it unless authorized by
statute, and in the manner the statute prescribes."
Id. at 40, 43 S.Ct. 254 (quoting Gayler v. Wilder, 51 U.S.
(10 How.) 477, 494, 13 L.Ed. 504 (1850)). That text is
substantively identical to the Court's expression of the
nature of copyright in Wheaton, 33 U.S. at 663-64:
This right [in copyright] ... does not exist at common law — it
originated, if at all, under the acts of congress. No one can deny that
when the legislature are about to vest an exclusive right in an
author or an inventor, they have the power to prescribe the
conditions on which such right shall be enjoyed....
Crown Die effectively creates a presumption that, when
we consider standing under a statutory scheme
involving intellectual property, common law doctrine
does not apply.
Courts continue to read the patent statute to mean that,
in general, only a patentee (or an exclusive licensee who
possesses all substantial rights in the patent) may
institute an action for infringement. See Prima Tek II,
L.L.C. v. A-Roo Co., 222 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2000)
("Standing to sue for infringement depends entirely on
the putative plaintiff's proprietary interest in the patent,
not on any contractual arrangements among the parties
regarding who may sue and who will be bound by
judgments.... [A]'right to sue' clause cannot confer
standing on a bare licensee...."); Ortho Pharm. Corp. v.
Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1030 (Fed.Cir.1995)
("Thus, the statute requires that the parties to an
infringement suit will have the patentee on one side and
the accused infringer on the other. Without the
patentee as plaintiff, the remedies provided in the patent
statute are unavailable except in extraordinary
circumstances as where the patentee is the infringer, and
cannot sue himself." (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
We should interpret the Copyright Act consistently
with the requirement of the Patent Act. Despite the
differences between patents and copyrights, and
between the statutes governing them, the common
question is whether a substantive, exclusive right to
intellectual property may be divorced from a cause of
action for infringement of that substantive right. Under
both copyright and patent law, substantive rights are
assignable; the question whether those rights are
severable from the entitlement to sue someone for
infringing those rights requires a similar analysis.
Crown Die rejected the centerpiece of the district court's
reasoning here, viz.: that because Congress did not
expressly proscribe the right to assign a cause of action
alone, such a right must exist. Instead, the Court used
the same logic that we have applied: No rights exist with
respect to patents unless they are created affirmatively
by Congress, and courts may recognize only those rights
that appear in the statute.
D. Cases From Other Circuits
Last but not least, we turn for guidance to the case law
of other courts. Two other [402 F.3d 889] circuits have
faced questions somewhat similar to the one we
confront here. We find the Fifth Circuit's decision
under the 1909 Copyright Act to be less persuasive than
the Second Circuit's more recent opinion under the
1976 Copyright Act.
In Prather v. Neva Paperbacks, Inc., 410 F.2d 698, 699
(5th Cir.1969), an author's publisher assigned to the
author both the copyright to the author's work and the
accrued causes of action related to the work. When the
author sued the publisher for copyright infringement,
the publisher claimed that the author lacked standing to
sue. Id. The Fifth Circuit disagreed and held that the
publisher clearly had transferred the right to sue to the
author; the author, therefore, could maintain an action
for infringement. Id. at 700.
Prather is unhelpful authority for two reasons. First, it
was decided before the 1976 Copyright Act was enacted
and thus does not bear on how we should interpret §
501(b). The predecessor to the 1976 Act, the 1909 Act,
simply afforded the "proprietor" of a copyright the right
to sue for infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 101(b) (1952); see
also Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright § 132 (1976). The 1909 Act did not define
"proprietor" or "exclusive rights," nor did it provide that
"legal or beneficial owners" of exclusive rights were
entitled to sue for infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 101(b)
(1952). Those features, missing in the 1909 Act, but
present in the 1976 Act, are central to a decision on the
present question.
Second, the assignment in Prather involved both
accrued causes of action and some of what we now
would call exclusive rights. The contract included an
assignment of "all ... right, title and interest in and to the
copyright" of the book involved. Prather, 410 F.2d at
699 n. 1. Therefore, the Prather court was not faced, as
we are, with a situation in which the owner of all the
exclusive rights and the owner of the accrued causes of
action are two different people.
The Second Circuit came to a different conclusion under
the 1976 Copyright Act. In Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee
Undergarment Co., 697 F.2d 27 (2d Cir.1982),
superseded by rule and statute on other grounds, the
court held that one who owns no exclusive right in a
copyright may not sue for infringement. The court
explained:
Eden apparently believed that a third basis for standing under the
Copyright Act existed, namely authorization by the copyright
holder of suit by a person other than an exclusive licensee. Clause 9
of the 1975 Eden/Paddington agreement ... contemplates such an
arrangement. We do not believe that the Copyright Act permits
holders of rights under copyrights to choose third parties to bring
suits on their behalf. While F.R. Civ. P. 17(a) ordinarily permits the
real party in interest to ratify a suit brought by another party, the
Copyright Law is quite specific in stating that only the "owner of an
exclusive right under a copyright" may bring suit.
Id. at 32 n. 3 (citations omitted).
It is not entirely clear whether the copyright holder in
Eden Toys had granted to Eden the right to sue on
accrued causes of action, as is the case here, or only the
right to sue prospectively. Whether the assignment was
prospective or retrospective, however, the court made
plain the basic principle, which we also have derived
from § 501(b) and its context and history, that only the
owner of an exclusive right under the copyright is
entitled to sue for infringement.
A few years later, the Second Circuit decided ABKCO
Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 944 F.2d 971, 980
(2d Cir.1991),[402 F.3d 890] a copyright case in which
ABKCO had bought both the copyright to a song
and"any and all rights assertable under copyright against
the Infringing Composition in any part of the world
which may have heretofore arisen or which may
hereafter arise." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
Although the infringement in question had occurred
before ABKCO bought the copyright, the court held
that ABKCO could sue the infringer "not out of its
ownership of the copyright, but from its ownership of
the claims themselves which it purchased, along with
the copyright, in 1978." Id. at 981. The Second Circuit
made clear that its decision was limited to the situation
in which the same entity purchased both the copyright
and accrued claims;1 the only issue was one of timing,
whether ownership of the copyright and occurrence of
the infringement had to coincide. The court reaffirmed
the principle of Eden Toys that a party that has no
ownership interest has no standing to sue; "the
Copyright Act does not permit copyright holders to
choose third parties to bring suits on their behalf." Id. at
980.
We think it important to parallel the Second Circuit for
two reasons. First, and more importantly, our
independent analysis leads us to the same conclusion.
Second, the creation of a circuit split would be
particularly troublesome in the realm of copyright.2 The
Supreme Court has noted "Congress' paramount goal in
revising the 1976 Act of enhancing predictability and
certainty of copyright ownership." Cmty. for Creative
Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 749, 109 S.Ct.
2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989). As we have phrased it,
"[c]ongressional intent to have national uniformity in
copyright laws is clear." Syntek Semiconductor Co. v.
Microchip Tech. Inc., 307 F.3d 775, 781 (9th Cir.2002).
That admonition makes sense, given the nature of
intellectual property. Inconsistent rules among the
circuits would lead to different levels of protection in
different areas of the country, even if the same alleged
infringement is occurring nationwide.
CONCLUSION
The bare assignment of an accrued cause of action is
impermissible under 17 U.S.C. § 501(b). Because that is
all Frank & Bob Films conveyed to Silvers, Silvers was
not entitled to institute and may not maintain this
action against Sony for alleged infringement of the
copyright in "The Other Woman."
