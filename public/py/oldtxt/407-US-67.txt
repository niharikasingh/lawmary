We here review the decisions of two three-judge federal
District Courts that upheld the constitutionality of
Florida and Pennsylvania laws authorizing the summary
seizure of goods or chattels in a person's possession
under a writ of replevin. Both statutes provide for the
issuance of writs ordering state agents to seize a person's
possessions, simply upon the ex parte application of any
other person who claims a right to them and posts a
[407 U.S. 70] security bond. Neither statute provides for
notice to be given to the possessor of the property, and
neither statute gives the possessor an opportunity to
challenge the seizure at any kind of prior hearing. The
question is whether these statutory procedures violate
the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no State
shall deprive any person of property without due
process of law.
I
The appellant in No. 5039, Margarita Fuentes, is a
resident of Florida. She purchased a gas stove and
service policy from the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.
(Firestone) under a conditional sales contract calling for
monthly payments over a period of time. A few months
later, she purchased a stereophonic phonograph from
the same company under the same sort of contract. The
total cost of the stove and stereo was about $500, plus an
additional financing charge of over $100. Under the
contracts, Firestone retained title to the merchandise,
but Mrs. Fuentes was entitled to possession unless and
until she should default on her installment payments.
For more than a year, Mrs. Fuentes made her
installment payments. But then, with only about $200
remaining to be paid, a dispute developed between her
and Firestone over the servicing of the stove. Firestone
instituted an action in a small-claims court for
repossession of both the stove and the stereo, claiming
that Mrs. Fuentes had refused to make her remaining
payments. Simultaneously with the filing of that action
and before Mrs. Fuentes had even received a summons
to answer its complaint, Firestone obtained a writ of
replevin ordering a sheriff to seize the disputed goods at
once.
In conformance with Florida procedure,1 Firestone [407
U.S. 71] had only to fill in the blanks on the appropriate
form documents and submit them to the clerk of the
small-claims court. The clerk signed and stamped the
documents and issued a writ of replevin. Later the same
day, a local deputy sheriff and an agent of Firestone
went to Mrs. Fuentes' home and seized the stove and
stereo.
Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Fuentes instituted the present
action in a federal district court, challenging the
constitutionality of the Florida prejudgment replevin
procedures under the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.2 She sought declaratory and
injunctive relief against continued enforcement of the
procedural provisions of the state statutes that authorize
prejudgment replevin.3
The appellants in No. 5138 filed a very similar action in
a federal district court in Pennsylvania, challenging the
constitutionality of that State's prejudgment replevin
process. Like Mrs. Fuentes, they had had possessions
seized under writs of replevin. Three of the appellants
had purchased personal property—a bed, a table, and
other household goods—under installment sales
contracts like the one signed by Mrs. Fuentes; and the
sellers of the property had obtained and executed
summary writs of replevin, claiming that the appellants
had fallen behind in their installment payments. [407
U.S. 72] The experience of the fourth appellant, Rosa
Washington, had been more bizarre. She had been
divorced from a local deputy sheriff and was engaged in
a dispute with him over the custody of their son. Her
former husband, being familiar with the routine forms
used in the replevin process, had obtained a writ that
ordered the seizure of the boy's clothes, furniture, and
toys.4
In both No. 5039 and No. 5138, three-judge District
Courts were convened to consider the appellants'
challenges to the constitutional validity of the Florida
and Pennsylvania statutes. The courts in both cases
upheld the constitutionality of the statutes. Fuentes v.
Fair-cloth, 317 F.Supp. 954 (SD Fla); Epps v. Cortese,
326 F.Supp. 127 (ED Pa.).5 We noted probable
jurisdiction of both appeals. 401 U.S. 906; 402 U.S. 994.
[407 U.S. 73] II
Under the Florida statute challenged here,6 "[a]ny
person whose goods or chattels are wrongfully detained
by any other person . . . may have a writ of replevin to
recover them . . . ." Fla. Stat. Ann. § 78.01 (Supp. 1972-
1973). There is no requirement that the applicant make
a convincing showing before the seizure [407 U.S. 74]
that the goods are, in fact, "wrongfully detained."
Rather, Florida law automatically relies on the bare
assertion of the party seeking the writ that he is entitled
to one and allows a court clerk to issue the writ
summarily. It requires only that the applicant file a
complaint, initiating a court action for repossession and
reciting in conclusory fashion that he is "lawfully
entitled to the possession" of the property, and that he
file a security bond
"in at least double the value of the property to be replevied
conditioned that plaintiff will prosecute his action to effect and
without delay and that if defendant recovers judgment against him
in the action, he will return the property, if return thereof is
adjudged, and will pay defendant all sums of money recovered
against plaintiff by defendant in the action." Fla. Stat. Ann. § 78.07
(Supp. 1972-1973).
[407 U.S. 75] On the sole basis of the complaint and
bond, a writ is issued "command[ing] the officer to
whom it may be directed to replevy the goods and
chattels in possession of defendant . . . and to summon
the defendant to answer the complaint." Fla. Stat. Ann.
§ 78.08 (Supp. 1972-1973). If the goods are "in any
dwelling house or other building or enclosure," the
officer is required to demand their delivery; but, if they
are not delivered, "he shall cause such house, building or
enclosure to be broken open and shall make replevin
according to the writ . . . ." Fla. Stat. Ann. § 78.10 (Supp.
1972-1973).
Thus, at the same moment that the defendant receives
the complaint seeking repossession of property through
court action, the property is seized from him. He is
provided no prior notice and allowed no opportunity
whatever to challenge the issuance of the writ. After the
property has been seized, he will eventually have an
opportunity for a hearing, as the defendant in the trial of
the court action for repossession, which the plaintiff is
required to pursue. And he is also not wholly without
recourse in the meantime. For under the Florida statute,
the officer who seizes the property must keep it for
three days, and during that period the defendant may
reclaim possession of the property by posting his own
security bond in double its value. But if he does not post
such a bond, the property is transferred to the party who
sought the writ, pending a final judgment in the
underlying action for repossession. Fla. Stat. Ann. §
78.13 (Supp. 1972-1973).
The Pennsylvania law7 differs, though not in its
essential nature, from that of Florida. As in Florida, [407
U.S. 76] a private party may obtain a prejudgment writ
of replevin through a summary process of ex parte
application to a prothonotary. As in Florida, the party
seeking [407 U.S. 77] the writ may simply post with his
application a bond in double the value of the property to
be seized. Pa. Rule Civ. Proc. 1073 (a). There is no
opportunity for a prior hearing and no prior notice to
the other party. On this basis, a sheriff is required to
execute the writ by seizing the specified property.
Unlike the Florida statute, however, the Pennsylvania
law does not require that there ever be opportunity for a
hearing on the merits of the conflicting claims to
possession of the replevied property. The party seeking
the writ is not obliged to initiate a court action for
repossession.8 Indeed, [407 U.S. 78] he need not even
formally allege that he is lawfully entitled to the
property. The most that is required is that he file an
"affidavit of the value of the property to be replevied."
Pa. Rule Civ. Proc. 1073 (a). If the party who loses
property through replevin seizure is to get even a post-
seizure hearing, he must initiate a lawsuit himself.9 He
may also, as under Florida law, post his own
counterbond within three days after the seizure to
regain possession. Pa. Rule Civ. Proc. 1076.
III
Although these prejudgment replevin statutes are
descended from the common-law replevin action of six
centuries ago, they bear very little resemblance to it.
Replevin at common law was an action for the return of
specific goods wrongfully taken or "distrained."
Typically, it was used after a landlord (the "distrainor")
had seized possessions from a tenant (the "distrainee") to
satisfy a debt allegedly owed. If the tenant then
instituted a replevin action and posted security, the
landlord could be ordered to return the property at [407
U.S. 79] once, pending a final judgment in the
underlying action.10 However, this prejudgment
replevin of goods at common law did not follow from
an entirely ex parte process of pleading by the distrainee.
For "[t]he distrainor could always stop the action of
replevin by claiming to be the owner of the goods; and
as this claim was often made merely to delay the
proceedings, the writ de proprietate probanda was
devised early in the fourteenth century, which enabled
the sheriff to determine summarily the question of
ownership. If the question of ownership was determined
against the distrainor the goods were delivered back to
the distrainee [pending final judgment]." 3 W.
Holdsworth, History of English Law 284 (1927).
Prejudgment replevin statutes like those of Florida and
Pennsylvania are derived from this ancient possessory
action in that they authorize the seizure of property
before a final judgment. But the similarity ends there. As
in the present cases, such statutes are most commonly
used by creditors to seize goods allegedly wrongfully
detained—not wrongfully taken—by debtors. At
common law, if a creditor wished to invoke state power
to recover goods wrongfully detained, he had to proceed
through the action of debt or detinue.11 These actions,
however, did not provide for a return of property before
final judgment.12 And, more importantly, on the
occasions when the common law did allow prejudgment
seizure by state power, it provided some kind [407 U.S.
80] of notice and opportunity to be heard to the party
then in possession of the property, and a state official
made at least a summary determination of the relative
rights of the disputing parties before stepping into the
dispute and taking goods from one of them.
IV
For more than a century the central meaning of
procedural due process has been clear: "Parties whose
rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in
order that they may enjoy that right they must first be
notified." Baldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall. 223, 233. See
Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274; Hovey v. Elliott, 167
U.S. 409; Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385. It is equally
fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity
to be heard "must be granted at a meaningful time and
in a meaningful manner." Armstrong v. Manzo, 380
U.S. 545, 552.
The primary question in the present cases is whether
these state statutes are constitutionally defective in
failing to provide for hearings "at a meaningful time."
The Florida replevin process guarantees an opportunity
for a hearing after the seizure of goods, and the
Pennsylvania process allows a post-seizure hearing if the
aggrieved party shoulders the burden of initiating one.
But neither the Florida nor the Pennsylvania statute
provides for notice or an opportunity to be heard before
the seizure. The issue is whether procedural due process
in the context of these cases requires an opportunity for
a hearing before the State authorizes its agents to seize
property in the possession of a person upon the
application of another.
The constitutional right to be heard is a basic aspect of
the duty of government to follow a fair process of
decisionmaking when it acts to deprive a person of his
possessions. The purpose of this requirement is not [407
U.S. 81] only to ensure abstract fair play to the
individual. Its purpose, more particularly, is to protect
his use and possession of property from arbitrary
encroachment— to minimize substantively unfair or
mistaken deprivations of property, a danger that is
especially great when the State seizes goods simply upon
the application of and for the benefit of a private party.
So viewed, the prohibition against the deprivation of
property without due process of law reflects the high
value, embedded in our constitutional and political
history, that we place on a person's right to enjoy what
is his, free of governmental interference. See Lynch v.
Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 552.
The requirement of notice and an opportunity to be
heard raises no impenetrable barrier to the taking of a
person's possessions. But the fair process of
decisionmaking that it guarantees works, by itself, to
protect against arbitrary deprivation of property. For
when a person has an opportunity to speak up in his
own defense, and when the State must listen to what he
has to say, substantively unfair and simply mistaken
deprivations of property interests can be prevented. It
has long been recognized that "fairness can rarely be
obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts
decisive of rights. . . . [And n]o better instrument has
been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person
in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him
and opportunity to meet it." Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee
Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170-172
(Frankfurter, J., concurring).
If the right to notice and a hearing is to serve its full
purpose, then, it is clear that it must be granted at a time
when the deprivation can still be prevented. At a later
hearing, an individual's possessions can be returned to
him if they were unfairly or mistakenly taken in the first
place. Damages may even be [407 U.S. 82] awarded to
him for the wrongful deprivation. But no later hearing
and no damage award can undo the fact that the
arbitrary taking that was subject to the right of
procedural due process has already occurred. "This
Court has not . . . embraced the general proposition that
a wrong may be done if it can be undone." Stanley v.
Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 647.
This is no new principle of constitutional law. The right
to a prior hearing has long been recognized by this
Court under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments.
Although the Court has held that due process tolerates
variances in the form of a hearing "appropriate to the
nature of the case," Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co.,
339 U.S. 306, 313, and "depending upon the importance
of the interests involved and the nature of the
subsequent proceedings [if any]," Boddie v. Connecticut,
401 U.S. 371, 378, the Court has traditionally insisted
that, whatever its form, opportunity for that hearing
must be provided before the deprivation at issue takes
effect. E. g., Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 542;
Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437;
Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254; Armstrong v. Manzo,
380 U. S., at 551; Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co.,
supra, at 313; Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, 312
U.S. 126, 152-153; United States v. Illinois Central R.
Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463; Londoner v. City & County of
Denver, 210 U.S. 373, 385-386. See In re Ruffalo, 390
U.S. 544, 550-551. "That the hearing required by due
process is subject to waiver, and is not fixed in form
does not affect its root requirement that an individual be
given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived
of any significant property interest, except for
extraordinary situations where some valid
governmental interest is at stake that justifies
postponing the hearing until after the event." Boddie v.
Connecticut, supra, at 378-379 (emphasis in original).
[407 U.S. 83] The Florida and Pennsylvania
prejudgment replevin statutes fly in the face of this
principle. To be sure, the requirements that a party
seeking a writ must first post a bond, allege conclusorily
that he is entitled to specific goods, and open himself to
possible liability in damages if he is wrong, serve to
deter wholly unfounded applications for a writ. But
those requirements are hardly a substitute for a prior
hearing, for they test no more than the strength of the
applicant's own belief in his rights.13 Since his private
gain is at stake, the danger is all too great that his
confidence in his cause will be misplaced. Lawyers and
judges are familiar with the phenomenon of a party
mistakenly but firmly convinced that his view of the
facts and law will prevail, and therefore quite willing to
risk the costs of litigation. Because of the
understandable, selfinterested fallibility of litigants, a
court does not decide a dispute until it has had an
opportunity to hear both sides—and does not generally
take even tentative action until it has itself examined the
support for the plaintiff's position. The Florida and
Pennsylvania statutes do not even require the official
issuing a writ of replevin to do that much.
The minimal deterrent effect of a bond requirement is,
in a practical sense, no substitute for an informed
evaluation by a neutral official. More specifically, as a
matter of constitutional principle, it is no replacement
for the right to a prior hearing that is the only truly
effective safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of
property. While the existence of these other, less [407
U.S. 84] effective, safeguards may be among the
considerations that affect the form of hearing demanded
by due process, they are far from enough by themselves
to obviate the right to a prior hearing of some kind.
V
The right to a prior hearing, of course, attaches only to
the deprivation of an interest encompassed within the
Fourteenth Amendment's protection. In the present
cases, the Florida and Pennsylvania statutes were applied
to replevy chattels in the appellants' possession. The
replevin was not cast as a final judgment; most, if not all,
of the appellants lacked full title to the chattels; and their
claim even to continued possession was a matter in
dispute. Moreover, the chattels at stake were nothing
more than an assortment of household goods.
Nonetheless, it is clear that the appellants were deprived
of possessory interests in those chattels that were within
the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.
A
A deprivation of a person's possessions under a
prejudgment writ of replevin, at least in theory, may be
only temporary. The Florida and Pennsylvania statutes
do not require a person to wait until a post-seizure
hearing and final judgment to recover what has been
replevied. Within three days after the seizure, the
statutes allow him to recover the goods if he, in return,
surrenders other property—a payment necessary to
secure a bond in double the value of the goods seized
from him.14 But it is now [407 U.S. 85] well settled that a
temporary, nonfinal deprivation of property is
nonetheless a "deprivation" in the terms of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Sniadach v. Family Finance
Corp., 395 U.S. 337; Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535. Both
Sniadach and Bell involved takings of property pending
a final judgment in an underlying dispute. In both cases,
the challenged statutes included recovery provisions,
allowing the defendants to post security to quickly
regain the property taken from them.15 Yet the Court
firmly held that these were deprivations of property that
had to be preceded by a fair hearing.
The present cases are no different. When officials of
Florida or Pennsylvania seize one piece of property from
a person's possession and then agree to return it if he
surrenders another, they deprive him of property
whether or not he has the funds, the knowledge, and the
time needed to take advantage of the recovery
provision. [407 U.S. 86] The Fourteenth Amendment
draws no bright lines around three-day, 10-day or 50-
day deprivations of property. Any significant taking of
property by the State is within the purview of the Due
Process Clause. While the length and consequent
severity of a deprivation may be another factor to weigh
in determining the appropriate form of hearing, it is not
decisive of the basic right to a prior hearing of some
kind.
B
The appellants who signed conditional sales contracts
lacked full legal title to the replevied goods. The
Fourteenth Amendment's protection of "property,"
however, has never been interpreted to safeguard only
the rights of undisputed ownership. Rather, it has been
read broadly to extend protection to "any significant
property interest," Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S., at
379, including statutory entitlements. See Bell v. Burson,
402 U. S., at 539; Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S., at 262.
The appellants were deprived of such an interest in the
replevied goods—the interest in continued possession
and use of the goods. See Sniadach v. Family Finance
Corp., 395 U. S., at 342 (Harlan, J., concurring). They
had acquired this interest under the conditional sales
contracts that entitled them to possession and use of the
chattels before transfer of title. In exchange for
immediate possession, the appellants had agreed to pay a
major financing charge beyond the basic price of the
merchandise. Moreover, by the time the goods were
summarily repossessed, they had made substantial
installment payments. Clearly, their possessory interest
in the goods, dearly bought and protected by contract,16
[407 U.S. 87] was sufficient to invoke the protection of
the Due Process Clause.
Their ultimate right to continued possession was, of
course, in dispute. If it were shown at a hearing that the
appellants had defaulted on their contractual
obligations, it might well be that the sellers of the goods
would be entitled to repossession. But even assuming
that the appellants had fallen behind in their installment
payments, and that they had no other valid defenses,17
that is immaterial here. The right to be heard does not
depend upon an advance showing that one will surely
prevail at the hearing. "To one who protests against the
taking of his property without due process of law, it is
no answer to say that in his particular case due process
of law would have led to the same result because he had
no adequate defense upon the merits." Coe v. Armour
Fertilizer Works, 237 U.S. 413, 424. It is enough to
invoke the procedural safeguards of the Fourteenth
Amendment that a significant property interest is at
stake, whatever the ultimate outcome of a hearing on
the contractual right to continued possession and use of
the goods.18
[407 U.S. 88] C
Nevertheless, the District Courts rejected the appellants'
constitutional claim on the ground that the goods seized
from them—a stove, a stereo, a table, a bed, and so
forth—were not deserving of due process protection,
since they were not absolute necessities of life. The
courts based this holding on a very narrow reading of
Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., supra, and Goldberg
v. Kelly, supra, in which this Court held that the
Constitution requires a hearing before prejudgment
wage garnishment and before the termination of certain
welfare benefits. They reasoned that Sniadach and
Goldberg, as a matter of constitutional principle,
established no more than that a prior hearing is required
with respect to the deprivation of such basically
"necessary" items as wages and welfare benefits.
This reading of Sniadach and Goldberg reflects the
premise that those cases marked a radical departure
from established principles of procedural due process.
They did not. Both decisions were in the mainstream of
past cases, having little or nothing to do with the
absolute "necessities" of life but establishing that due
process requires an opportunity for a hearing before a
deprivation of property takes effect.19 E. g., Opp Cotton
Mills v. Administrator, 312 U. S., at 152-153; United
States v. Illinois Central R. Co., 291 U. S., at 463;
Southern R. Co. v. Virginia, 290 U.S. 190; Londoner v.
City & County of Denver, 210 U.S. 373; Central of
Georgia v. Wright, 207 U.S. 127; Security Trust Co. v.
Lexington, 203 U.S. 323;[407 U.S. 89] Hibben v. Smith,
191 U.S. 310; Glidden v. Harrington, 189 U.S. 255. In
none of those cases did the Court hold that this most
basic due process requirement is limited to the
protection of only a few types of property interests.
While Sniadach and Goldberg emphasized the special
importance of wages and welfare benefits, they did not
convert that emphasis into a new and more limited
constitutional doctrine.20
Nor did they carve out a rule of "necessity" for the sort
of nonfinal deprivations of property that they involved.
That was made clear in Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535,
holding that there must be an opportunity for a fair
hearing before mere suspension of a driver's license. A
driver's license clearly does not rise to the level of
"necessity" exemplified by wages and welfare benefits.
Rather, as the Court accurately stated, it is an
"important interest," id., at 539, entitled to the
protection of procedural due process of law.
The household goods, for which the appellants
contracted and paid substantial sums, are deserving of
similar protection. While a driver's license, for example,
"may become [indirectly] essential in the pursuit of a
livelihood," ibid., a stove or a bed may be equally
essential to provide a minimally decent environment for
human beings in their day-to-day lives. It is, after all,
such consumer goods that people work and earn a
livelihood in order to acquire.
No doubt, there may be many gradations in the
"importance" or "necessity" of various consumer goods.
Stoves could be compared to television sets, or beds [407
U.S. 90] could be compared to tables. But if the root
principle of procedural due process is to be applied with
objectivity, it cannot rest on such distinctions. The
Fourteenth Amendment speaks of "property" generally.
And, under our free-enterprise system, an individual's
choices in the marketplace are respected, however
unwise they may seem to someone else. It is not the
business of a court adjudicating due process rights to
make its own critical evaluation of those choices and
protect only the ones that, by its own lights, are
"necessary."21
VI
There are "extraordinary situations" that justify
postponing notice and opportunity for a hearing. Boddie
v. Connecticut, 401 U. S., at 379. These situations,
however, must be truly unusual.22 Only in a few limited
situations [407 U.S. 91] has this Court allowed outright
seizure23 without opportunity for a prior hearing. First,
in each case, the seizure has been directly necessary to
secure an important governmental or general public
interest. Second, there has been a special need for very
prompt action. Third, the State has kept strict control
over its monopoly of legitimate force: the person
initiating the seizure has been a government official
responsible for determining, under the standards of a
narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and
justified in the particular instance. Thus, the Court has
allowed summary seizure of property [407 U.S. 92] to
collect the internal revenue of the United States,24 to
meet the needs of a national war effort,25 to protect
against the economic disaster of a bank failure,26 and to
protect the public from misbranded drugs27 and
contaminated food.28
The Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment replevin
statutes serve no such important governmental or
general public interest. They allow summary seizure of a
person's possessions when no more than private gain is
directly at stake.29 The replevin of chattels, as in the
[407 U.S. 93] present cases, may satisfy a debt or settle a
score. But state intervention in a private dispute hardly
compares to state action furthering a war effort or
protecting the public health.
Nor do the broadly drawn Florida and Pennsylvania
statutes limit the summary seizure of goods to special
situations demanding prompt action. There may be
cases in which a creditor could make a showing of
immediate danger that a debtor will destroy or conceal
disputed goods. But the statutes before us are not
"narrowly drawn to meet any such unusual condition."
Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., supra, at 339. And no
such unusual situation is presented by the facts of these
cases.
The statutes, moreover, abdicate effective state control
over state power. Private parties, serving their own
private advantage, may unilaterally invoke state power
to replevy goods from another. No state official
participates in the decision to seek a writ; no state
official reviews the basis for the claim to repossession;
and no state official evaluates the need for immediate
seizure. There is not even a requirement that the
plaintiff provide any information to the court on these
matters. The State acts largely in the dark.30
[407 U.S. 94] VII
Finally, we must consider the contention that the
appellants who signed conditional sales contracts
thereby waived their basic procedural due process
rights. The contract signed by Mrs. Fuentes provided
that "in the event of default of any payment or
payments, Seller at its option may take back the
merchandise . . . ." The contracts signed by the
Pennsylvania appellants similarly provided that the
seller "may retake" or "repossess" the merchandise in the
event of a "default in any payment." These terms were
parts of printed form contracts, appearing in relatively
small type and unaccompanied by any explanations
clarifying their meaning.
In D. H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174, the
Court recently outlined the considerations relevant to
determination of a contractual waiver of due process
rights. Applying the standards governing waiver of
constitutional rights in a criminal proceeding31
—although not holding that such standards must
necessarily apply—the Court held that, on the particular
facts of that case, the contractual waiver of due process
[407 U.S. 95] rights was "voluntarily, intelligently, and
knowingly" made. Id., at 187. The contract in Overmyer
was negotiated between two corporations; the waiver
provision was specifically bargained for and drafted by
their lawyers in the process of these negotiations. As the
Court noted, it was "not a case of unequal bargaining
power or overreaching. The Overmyer-Frick
agreement, from the start, was not a contract of
adhesion." Id., at 186. Both parties were "aware of the
significance" of the waiver provision. Ibid.
The facts of the present cases are a far cry from those of
Overmyer. There was no bargaining over contractual
terms between the parties who, in any event, were far
from equal in bargaining power. The purported waiver
provision was a printed part of a form sales contract and
a necessary condition of the sale. The appellees made no
showing whatever that the appellants were actually
aware or made aware of the significance of the fine print
now relied upon as a waiver of constitutional rights.
The Court in Overmyer observed that "where the
contract is one of adhesion, where there is great
disparity in bargaining power, and where the debtor
receives nothing for the [waiver] provision, other legal
consequences may ensue." Id., at 188. Yet, as in
Overmyer, there is no need in the present cases to
canvass those consequences fully. For a waiver of
constitutional rights in any context must, at the very
least, be clear. We need not concern ourselves with the
involuntariness or unintelligence of a waiver when the
contractual language relied upon does not, on its face,
even amount to a waiver.
The conditional sales contracts here simply provided
that upon a default the seller "may take back," "may
retake" or "may repossess" merchandise. The contracts
[407 U.S. 96] included nothing about the waiver of a
prior hearing. They did not indicate how or through
what process— a final judgment, self-help, prejudgment
replevin with a prior hearing, or prejudgment replevin
without a prior hearing—the seller could take back the
goods. Rather, the purported waiver provisions here are
no more than a statement of the seller's right to
repossession upon occurrence of certain events. The
appellees do not suggest that these provisions waived
the appellants' right to a full post-seizure hearing to
determine whether those events had, in fact, occurred
and to consider any other available defenses. By the
same token, the language of the purported waiver
provisions did not waive the appellants' constitutional
right to a preseizure hearing of some kind.
VIII
We hold that the Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment
replevin provisions work a deprivation of property
without due process of law insofar as they deny the right
to a prior opportunity to be heard before chattels are
taken from their possessor.32 Our holding, however, is a
narrow one. We do not question the power of a State to
seize goods before a final judgment in order to protect
the security interests of creditors so long as those
creditors have tested their claim to the goods through
the process of a fair prior hearing. The nature and form
of such prior hearings, moreover, are legitimately open
to many potential variations and are a [407 U.S. 97]
subject, at this point, for legislation—not adjudication.33
Since the essential reason for the requirement of a prior
hearing is to prevent unfair and mistaken deprivations
of property, however, it is axiomatic that the hearing
must provide a real test. "[D]ue process is afforded only
by the kinds of `notice' and `hearing' that are aimed at
establishing the validity, or at least the probable validity,
of the underlying claim against the alleged debtor before
he can be deprived of his property . . . ." Sniadach v.
Family Finance Corp., supra, at 343 (Harlan, J.,
concurring). See Bell v. Burson, supra, at 540; Goldberg
v. Kelly, supra, at 267.
For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the District
Courts are vacated and these cases are remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
