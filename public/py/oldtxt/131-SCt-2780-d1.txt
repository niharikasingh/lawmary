A foreign industrialist seeks to develop a market in the
United States for machines it manufactures. It hopes to
derive substantial revenue from sales it makes to United
States purchasers. Where in the United States buyers
reside does not matter to this manufacturer. Its goal is
simply to sell as much as it can, wherever it can. It
excludes no region or State from the market it wishes to
reach. But, all things considered, it prefers to avoid
products liability litigation in the United States. To that
end, it engages a U.S. distributor to ship its machines
stateside. Has it succeeded in escaping personal
jurisdiction in a State where one of its products is sold
and causes injury or even death to a local user?
Under this Court's pathmarking precedent in
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66
S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), and subsequent decisions,
one would expect the answer to be unequivocally, [131
S.Ct. 2795] "No." But instead, six Justices of this Court,
in divergent opinions, tell us that the manufacturer has
avoided the jurisdiction of our state courts, except
perhaps in States where its products are sold in sizeable
quantities. Inconceivable as it may have seemed
yesterday, the splintered majority today "turn[s] the
clock back to the days before modern long-arm statutes
when a manufacturer, to avoid being haled into court
where a user is injured, need only Pilate-like wash its
hands of a product by having independent distributors
market it." Weintraub, A Map Out of the Personal
Jurisdiction Labyrinth, 28 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 531, 555
(1995).

On October 11, 2001, a three-ton metal shearing
machine severed four fingers on Robert Nicastro's right
hand. Nicastro v. McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd.,
201 N.J. 48, 53, 987 A.2d 575, 577 (2010); see App. 6a-8a
(Complaint). Alleging that the machine was a dangerous
product defectively made, Nicastro sought
compensation from the machine's manufacturer, J.
McIntyre Machinery Ltd. (McIntyre UK). Established in
1872 as a United Kingdom corporation, and
headquartered in Nottingham, England, McIntyre UK
"designs, develops and manufactures a complete range of
equipment for metal recycling." Id., at 22a, 33a. The
company's product line, as advertised on McIntyre UK's
Web site, includes "metal shears, balers, cable and can
recycling equipment, furnaces, casting equipment and ...
the world's best aluminium dross processing and cooling
system." Id., at 31a. McIntyre UK holds both United
States and European patents on its technology. 201 N.J.,
at 55, 987 A.2d, at 579; App. 36a.
The machine that injured Nicastro, a "McIntyre Model
640 Shear," sold in the United States for $24,900 in
1995, id., at 43a, and features a "massive cutting
capacity," id., at 44a. According to McIntyre UK's
product brochure, the machine is "use[d] throughout
the [w]orld." Ibid. McIntyre UK represented in the
brochure that, by "incorporat[ing] off-the-shelf
hydraulic parts from suppliers with international sales
outlets," the 640 Shear's design guarantees serviceability
"wherever [its customers] may be based." Ibid. The
instruction manual advises "owner[s] and operators of a
640 Shear [to] make themselves aware of [applicable
health and safety regulations]," including "the American
National Standards Institute Regulations (USA) for the
use of Scrap Metal Processing Equipment." Id., at 46a.
Nicastro operated the 640 Shear in the course of his
employment at Curcio Scrap Metal (CSM) in Saddle
Brook, New Jersey. Id., at 7a, 43a. "New Jersey has long
been a hotbed of scrap-metal businesses...." See Drake,
The Scrap-Heap Rollup Hits New Jersey, Business News
New Jersey, June 1, 1998, p. 1. In 2008, New Jersey
recycling facilities processed 2,013,730 tons of scrap
iron, steel, aluminum, and other metals—more than any
other State—outpacing Kentucky, its nearest
competitor, by nearly 30 percent. Von Haaren,
Themelis, & Goldstein, The State of Garbage in
America, BioCycle, Oct. 2010, p. 19.
CSM's owner, Frank Curcio, "first heard of [McIntyre
UK's] machine while attending an Institute of Scrap
Metal Industries [(ISRI)] convention in Las Vegas in
1994 or 1995, where [McIntyre UK] was an exhibitor."
App. 78a. ISRI "presents the world's largest scrap
recycling industry trade show each year." Id., at 47a. The
event attracts "owners [and] managers of scrap
processing companies" and others "interested in
seeing—and purchasing—new equipment." Id., at 48a-
49a. [131 S.Ct. 2796] According to ISRI, more than 3,000
potential buyers of scrap processing and recycling
equipment attend its annual conventions, "primarily
because th[e] exposition provides them with the most
comprehensive industry-related shopping experience
concentrated in a single, convenient location." Id., at
47a. Exhibitors who are ISRI members pay $3,000 for
10' x 10' booth space. Id., at 48a-49a.1
McIntyre UK representatives attended every ISRI
convention from 1990 through 2005. Id., at 114a-115a.
These annual expositions were held in diverse venues
across the United States; in addition to Las Vegas,
conventions were held 1990-2005 in New Orleans,
Orlando, San Antonio, and San Francisco. Ibid.
McIntyre UK's president, Michael Pownall, regularly
attended ISRI conventions. Ibid. He attended ISRI's Las
Vegas convention the year CSM's owner first learned of,
and saw, the 640 Shear. Id., at 78a-79a, 115a. McIntyre
UK exhibited its products at ISRI trade shows, the
company acknowledged, hoping to reach "anyone
interested in the machine from anywhere in the United
States." Id., at 161a.
Although McIntyre UK's U.S. sales figures are not in the
record, it appears that for several years in the 1990's,
earnings from sales of McIntyre UK products in the
United States "ha[d] been good" in comparison to "the
rest of the world." Id., at 136a (Letter from Sally
Johnson, McIntyre UK's Managing Director, to Gary
and Mary Gaither, officers of McIntyre UK's exclusive
distributor in the United States (Jan. 13, 1999)). In
response to interrogatories, McIntyre UK stated that its
commissioning engineer had installed the company's
equipment in several States—Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,
Virginia, and Washington. Id., at 119a.
From at least 1995 until 2001, McIntyre UK retained an
Ohio-based company, McIntyre Machinery America,
Ltd. (McIntyre America), "as its exclusive distributor for
the entire United States." Nicastro v. McIntyre
Machinery America, Ltd., 399 N.J.Super. 539, 558, 945
A.2d 92, 104 (App. 2008).2 Though similarly named, the
two companies were separate and independent entities
with "no commonality of ownership or management."
Id., at 545, 945 A.2d, at 95. In invoices and other written
communications, McIntyre America described itself as
McIntyre UK's national distributor, "America's Link" to
"Quality Metal Processing Equipment" from England.
App. 43a, 78a.
In a November 23, 1999 letter to McIntyre America,
McIntyre UK's president spoke plainly about the
manufacturer's objective in authorizing the exclusive
distributorship: "All we wish to do is sell our products in
the [United] States—and get paid!" Id., at 134a. Notably,
McIntyre America was concerned about U.S. litigation
involving McIntyre UK products, in which the
distributor had been named as a defendant. McIntyre
UK counseled McIntyre America to respond personally
to the litigation, but reassured its distributor that "the
product was built and designed by McIntyre Machinery
in the UK and the buck stops here—if there's something
[131 S.Ct. 2797] wrong with the machine." Id., at 129a-
130a. Answering jurisdictional interrogatories,
McIntyre UK stated that it had been named as a
defendant in lawsuits in Illinois, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, and West Virginia. Id., at 98a, 108a. And
in correspondence with McIntyre America, McIntyre
UK noted that the manufacturer had products liability
insurance coverage. Id., at 129a.
Over the years, McIntyre America distributed several
McIntyre UK products to U.S. customers, including, in
addition to the 640 Shear, McIntyre UK's "Niagara" and
"Tardis" systems, wire strippers, and can machines. Id.,
at 123a-128a. In promoting McIntyre UK's products at
conventions and demonstration sites and in trade
journal advertisements, McIntyre America looked to
McIntyre UK for direction and guidance. Ibid. To
achieve McIntyre UK's objective, i.e., "to sell [its]
machines to customers throughout the United States,"
399 N.J.Super., at 548, 945 A.2d, at 97, "the two
companies [were acting] closely in concert with each
other," ibid. McIntyre UK never instructed its
distributor to avoid certain States or regions of the
country; rather, as just noted, the manufacturer engaged
McIntyre America to attract customers "from anywhere
in the United States." App. 161a.
In sum, McIntyre UK's regular attendance and
exhibitions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful
step to reach customers for its products "anywhere in
the United States." At least as purposeful was McIntyre
UK's engagement of McIntyre America as the conduit
for sales of McIntyre UK's machines to buyers
"throughout the United States." Given McIntyre UK's
endeavors to reach and profit from the United States
market as a whole, Nicastro's suit, I would hold, has
been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for the
adjudication of his claim. He alleges that McIntyre UK's
shear machine was defectively designed or
manufactured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his
workplace. The machine arrived in Nicastro's New
Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously, but as a
result of the U.S. connections and distribution system
that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.3 On what
sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority
could the place of Nicastro's injury within the United
States be deemed off limits for his products liability
claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the
United States (including all the States that constitute the
Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?
II
A few points on which there should be no genuine
debate bear statement at the outset. First, all agree,
McIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (allpurpose)
jurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that
foreign-country corporation is hardly "at home" in New
Jersey. See Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.
Brown, post, at 2850-2851, 2854-2857. The question,
rather, is one of specific jurisdiction, which turns on an
"affiliatio[n] [131 S.Ct. 2798] between the forum and the
underlying controversy." Goodyear Dunlop, post, at
2851 (quoting von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction to
Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L.Rev. 1121,
1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren & Trautman);
internal quotation marks omitted); see also Goodyear
Dunlop, post, at 2853-2854.
Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of
adjudicatory authority among States of the United States
is present in this case. New Jersey's exercise of personal
jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose
dangerous product caused a workplace injury in New
Jersey does not tread on the domain, or diminish the
sovereignty, of any sister State. Indeed, among States of
the United States, the State in which the injury occurred
would seem most suitable for litigation of a products
liability tort claim. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.
v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62
L.Ed.2d 490 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor
endeavors to develop a market for a product in several
States, it is reasonable "to subject it to suit in one of
those States if its allegedly defective [product] has there
been the source of injury"); 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a)-(b) (in
federal-court suits, whether resting on diversity or
federal-question jurisdiction, venue is proper in the
judicial district "in which a substantial part of the events
or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred").
Third, the constitutional limits on a state court's
adjudicatory authority derive from considerations of due
process, not state sovereignty. As the Court clarified in
Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites
de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492
(1982):
"The restriction on state sovereign power described in WorldWide
Volkswagen Corp. ... must be seen as ultimately a function of
the individual liberty interest preserved by the Due Process Clause.
That Clause is the only source of the personal jurisdiction
requirement and the Clause itself makes no mention of federalism
concerns. Furthermore, if the federalism concept operated as an
independent restriction on the sovereign power of the court, it
would not be possible to waive the personal jurisdiction
requirement: Individual actions cannot change the powers of
sovereignty, although the individual can subject himself to powers
from which he may otherwise be protected." Id., at 703, n. 10, 102
S.Ct. 2099.
See also Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204, and n. 20,
97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977) (recognizing that
"the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States [is not]
the central concern of the inquiry into personal
jurisdiction"). But see ante, at 2788 (plurality opinion)
(asserting that "sovereign authority," not "fairness," is
the "central concept" in determining personal
jurisdiction).
Finally, in International Shoe itself, and decisions
thereafter, the Court has made plain that legal fictions,
notably "presence" and "implied consent," should be
discarded, for they conceal the actual bases on which
jurisdiction rests. See 326 U.S., at 316, 318, 66 S.Ct. 154;
Hutchinson v. Chase & Gilbert, 45 F.2d 139, 141 (C.A.2
1930) (L.Hand, J.) ("nothing is gained by [resort to
words that] concea[l] what we do"). "[T]he relationship
among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation"
determines whether due process permits the exercise of
personal jurisdiction over a defendant, Shaffer, 433 U.S.,
at 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, and "fictions of implied consent"
or "corporate presence" do not advance the proper
inquiry, id., at 202, 97 S.Ct. 2569. See also Burnham v.
Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604,
618, 110 S.Ct. 2105, 109 L.Ed.2d 631 (1990) [131 S.Ct.
2799] (plurality opinion) (International Shoe "cast ...
aside" fictions of "consent" and "presence").
Whatever the state of academic debate over the role of
consent in modern jurisdictional doctrines,4 the
plurality's notion that consent is the animating concept
draws no support from controlling decisions of this
Court. Quite the contrary, the Court has explained, a
forum can exercise jurisdiction when its contacts with
the controversy are sufficient; invocation of a fictitious
consent, the Court has repeatedly said, is unnecessary
and unhelpful. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.
Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85
L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (Due Process Clause permits "forum
... to assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state
defendant who has not consented to suit there"); McGee
v. International Life Ins.Co., 355 U.S. 220, 222, 78 S.Ct.
199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957) ("[T]his Court [has]
abandoned `consent,' `doing business,' and `presence' as
the standard for measuring the extent of state judicial
power over [out-of-state] corporations.").5
III
This case is illustrative of marketing arrangements for
sales in the United States common in today's
commercial world.6 A foreign-country manufacturer
engages a U.S. company to promote and distribute the
manufacturer's products, not in any particular State, but
anywhere and everywhere in the United States the
distributor can attract purchasers. The product proves
defective and injures a user in the State where the user
lives or works. Often, as here, the manufacturer will
have liability insurance covering personal injuries
caused by its products. See Cupp, Redesigning Successor
Liability, 1999 U. Ill. L.Rev. 845, 870-871 (noting the
ready availability of products liability insurance for
manufacturers and citing a study showing, "between
1986 and 1996, [such] insurance cost manufacturers, on
average, only sixteen cents for each $100 of product
sales"); App. 129-130.
[131 S.Ct. 2800] When industrial accidents happen, a
long-arm statute in the State where the injury occurs
generally permits assertion of jurisdiction, upon giving
proper notice, over the foreign manufacturer. For
example, the State's statute might provide, as does New
York's long-arm statute, for the "exercise [of] personal
jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary ... who ...
"commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person
or property within the state, ... if he ... expects or should reasonably
expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives
substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce."
N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. § 302(a)(3)(ii) (West 2008).7
Or, the State might simply provide, as New Jersey does,
for the exercise of jurisdiction "consistent with due
process of law." N.J. Ct. Rule 4:4-4(b)(1) (2011).8
The modern approach to jurisdiction over corporations
and other legal entities, ushered in by International
Shoe, gave prime place to reason and fairness. Is it not
fair and reasonable, given the mode of trading of which
this case is an example, to require the international seller
to defend at the place its products cause injury?9 Do not
litigational convenience10 and choice-of-law
considerations11 point in that direction? On what
measure of reason and fairness can it be considered
undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey
as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its
industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the
United States?12 Is not the burden on McIntyre [131 S.Ct.
2801] UK to defend in New Jersey fair, i.e., a reasonable
cost of transacting business internationally, in
comparison to the burden on Nicastro to go to
Nottingham, England to gain recompense for an injury
he sustained using McIntyre's product at his workplace
in Saddle Brook, New Jersey?
McIntyre UK dealt with the United States as a single
market. Like most foreign manufacturers, it was
concerned not with the prospect of suit in State X as
opposed to State Y, but rather with its subjection to suit
anywhere in the United States. See Hay, Judicial
Jurisdiction Over Foreign-Country Corporate
Defendants—Comments on Recent Case Law, 63 Ore.
L.Rev. 431, 433 (1984) (hereinafter Hay). As a McIntyre
UK officer wrote in an e-mail to McIntyre America:
"American law—who needs it?!" App. 129a-130a (e-mail
dated April 26, 1999 from Sally Johnson to Mary
Gaither). If McIntyre UK is answerable in the United
States at all, is it not "perfectly appropriate to permit the
exercise of that jurisdiction. . . at the place of injury"?
See Hay 435; Degnan & Kane, The Exercise of
Jurisdiction Over and Enforcement of Judgments
Against Alien Defendants, 39 Hastings L.J. 799, 813-815
(1988) (noting that "[i]n the international order," the
State that counts is the United States, not its component
States,13 and that the fair place of suit within the United
States is essentially a question of venue).
In sum, McIntyre UK, by engaging McIntyre America to
promote and sell its machines in the United States,
"purposefully availed itself "of the United States market
nationwide, not a market in a single State or a discrete
collection of States. McIntyre UK thereby availed itself
of the market of all States in which its products were
sold by its exclusive distributor. "Th[e] `purposeful
availment' requirement," this Court has explained,
simply "ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a
jurisdiction solely as a result of `random,' `fortuitous,' or
`attenuated' contacts." Burger King, 471 U.S., at 475,
105 S.Ct. 2174. Adjudicatory authority is appropriately
exercised where "actions by the defendant himself" give
rise to the affiliation with the forum. Ibid. How could
McIntyre UK not have intended, by its actions targeting
a national market, to sell products in the fourth largest
destination for imports among all States of the United
States and the largest scrap metal market? See supra, at
2795-2796, 2799, n. 6. But see ante, at 2790-2791
(plurality opinion) (manufacturer's purposeful efforts to
sell its products nationwide are "not . . . relevant" to the
personal jurisdiction inquiry).
Courts, both state and federal, confronting facts similar
to those here, have rightly rejected the conclusion that a
manufacturer selling its products across the USA may
evade jurisdiction in any and all States, including the
State where its defective product is distributed and
causes injury. They have held, instead, that it would
undermine principles of fundamental fairness to insulate
the foreign manufacturer from accountability in court at
the place within [131 S.Ct. 2802] the United States where
the manufacturer's products caused injury. See, e.g.,
Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc., 993 F.2d
528, 544 (C.A.6 1993); A. Uberti & C. v. Leonardo, 181
Ariz. 565, 573, 892 P.2d 1354, 1362 (1995).14
IV
A
While this Court has not considered in any prior case
the now-prevalent pattern presented here—a foreigncountry
manufacturer enlisting a U.S. distributor to
develop a market in the United States for the
manufacturer's products—none of the Court's decisions
tug against the judgment made by the New Jersey
Supreme Court. McIntyre contends otherwise, citing
World-Wide Volkswagen, and Asahi Metal Industry
Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U.S. 102,
107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987).
World-Wide Volkswagen concerned a New York car
dealership that sold solely in the New York market, and
a New York distributor who supplied retailers in three
States only: New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey.
444 U.S., at 289, 100 S.Ct. 559. New York residents had
purchased an Audi from the New York dealer and were
driving the new vehicle through Oklahoma en route to
Arizona. On the road in Oklahoma, another car struck
the Audi in the rear, causing a fire which severely
burned the Audi's occupants. Id., at 288, 100 S.Ct. 559.
Rejecting the Oklahoma courts' assertion of jurisdiction
over the New York dealer and distributor, this Court
observed that the defendants had done nothing to serve
the market for cars in Oklahoma. Id., at 295-298, 100
S.Ct. 559. Jurisdiction, the Court held, could not be
based on the customer's unilateral act of driving the
vehicle to Oklahoma. Id., at 298, 100 S.Ct. 559; see
Asahi, 480 U.S., at 109, 107 S.Ct. 1026 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.) (World-Wide Volkswagen "rejected the
assertion that a consumer's unilateral act of bringing the
defendant's product into the forum State was a sufficient
constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the
defendant").
Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in
World-Wide Volkswagen did not object to the
jurisdiction of the Oklahoma courts and the U.S.
importer abandoned its initially stated objection. 444
U.S., at 288, and n. 3, 100 S.Ct. 559. And most relevant
here, the Court's opinion indicates that an objection to
jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national distributor
would have been unavailing. To reiterate, the Court said
in World-Wide Volkswagen that, when a manufacturer
or distributor aims to sell its product to customers in
several States, it is reasonable "to subject it to suit in
[any] one of those States if its allegedly defective
[product] has there been the source of injury." Id., at
297, 100 S.Ct. 559.
Asahi arose out of a motorcycle accident in California.
Plaintiff, a California resident injured in the accident,
sued the Taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle's
tire tubes, claiming that defects in its product caused the
accident. The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against
Asahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and
Asahi contested the California courts' jurisdiction. By
the time the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff
had settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the
Taiwanese company against the Japanese valveassembly
manufacturer remained.
The decision was not a close call. The Court had before
it a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and a
foreign defendant, [131 S.Ct. 2803] the Japanese valveassembly
maker, and the indemnification dispute
concerned a transaction between those parties that
occurred abroad. All agreed on the bottom line: The
Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer was not
reasonably brought into the California courts to litigate
a dispute with another foreign party over a transaction
that took place outside the United States.
Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling
opinions of Justice Brennan and Justice O'Connor were
hardly necessary. How the Court would have
"estimate[d]. . . the inconveniences," see International
Shoe, 326 U.S., at 317, 66 S.Ct. 154 (internal quotation
marks omitted), had the injured Californian originally
sued Asahi is a debatable question. Would this Court
have given the same weight to the burdens on the
foreign defendant had those been counterbalanced by
the burdens litigating in Japan imposed on the local
California plaintiff? Cf. Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783,
788, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984) (a plaintiff's
contacts with the forum "may be so manifold as to
permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their
absence").
In any event, Asahi, unlike McIntyre UK, did not itself
seek out customers in the United States, it engaged no
distributor to promote its wares here, it appeared at no
tradeshows in the United States, and, of course, it had
no Web site advertising its products to the world.
Moreover, Asahi was a component-part manufacturer
with "little control over the final destination of its
products once they were delivered into the stream of
commerce." A. Uberti, 181 Ariz., at 572, 892 P.2d, at
1361. It was important to the Court in Asahi that "those
who use Asahi components in their final products, and
sell those products in California, [would be] subject to
the application of California tort law." 480 U.S., at 115,
107 S.Ct. 1026 (majority opinion). To hold that Asahi
controls this case would, to put it bluntly, be dead
wrong.15
B
The Court's judgment also puts United States plaintiffs
at a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated
complainants elsewhere in the world. Of particular note,
within the European Union, in which the United
Kingdom is a participant, the jurisdiction New Jersey
would have exercised is not at all exceptional. The
European Regulation on Jurisdiction and the
Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments provides
for the exercise of specific jurisdiction "in matters
relating to tort . . . in the courts for the place where the
harmful event occurred." Council Reg. 44/2001, Art. 5,
2001 O.J. (L.12) 4.16 The European Court of Justice has
interpreted this prescription to authorize jurisdiction
either where the harmful act occurred or at the [131 S.Ct.
2804] place of injury. See Handelskwekerij G.J. Bier B.V.
v. Mines de Potasse d'Alsace S. A., 1976 E.C.R. 1735,
1748-1749.17
V
The commentators who gave names to what we now
call "general jurisdiction" and "specific jurisdiction"
anticipated that when the latter achieves its full growth,
considerations of litigational convenience and the
respective situations of the parties would determine
when it is appropriate to subject a defendant to trial in
the plaintiff's community. See von Mehren & Trautman
1166-1179. Litigational considerations include "the
convenience of witnesses and the ease of ascertaining
the governing law." Id., at 1168-1169. As to the parties,
courts would differently appraise two situations: (1)
cases involving a substantially local plaintiff, like
Nicastro, injured by the activity of a defendant engaged
in interstate or international trade; and (2) cases in
which the defendant is a natural or legal person whose
economic activities and legal involvements are largely
home-based, i.e., entities without designs to gain
substantial revenue from sales in distant markets. See
id., at 1167-1169.18 As the attached appendix of
illustrative cases indicates, courts presented with von
Mehren and Trautman's first scenario—a local plaintiff
injured by the activity of a manufacturer seeking to
exploit a multistate or global market—have repeatedly
confirmed that jurisdiction is appropriately exercised by
courts of the place where the product was sold and
caused injury.

For the reasons stated, I would hold McIntyre UK
answerable in New Jersey for the harm Nicastro suffered
at his workplace in that State using McIntyre UK's
shearing machine. While I dissent from the Court's
judgment, I take heart that the plurality opinion does
not speak for the Court, for that opinion would take a
giant step away from the "notions of fair play and
substantial justice" underlying International Shoe. 326
U.S., at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
