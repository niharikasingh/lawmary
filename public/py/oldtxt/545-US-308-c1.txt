The Court faithfully applies our precedents interpreting
28 U. S. C. § 1331 to authorize federal-court jurisdiction
over some cases in which state law creates the cause of
action but requires determination of an issue of federal
law, e. g., Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.
S. 180 (1921); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Thompson, 478 U. S. 804 (1986). In this case, no one
has asked us to overrule those precedents and adopt the
rule Justice Holmes set forth in American Well Works
Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257 (1916),
limiting § 1331 jurisdiction to cases in which federal law
creates the cause of action pleaded on the face of the
plaintiff's complaint. Id., at 260. In an appropriate case,
and perhaps with the benefit of better evidence as to the
original meaning of § 1331's text, I would be willing to
consider that course.[*]
[545 U.S. 321] Jurisdictional rules should be clear.
Whatever the virtues of the Smith standard, it is
anything but clear. Ante, at 313 (the standard "calls for a
`common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the]
kaleidoscopic situations' that present a federal issue, in
`a selective process which picks the substantial causes
out of the web and lays the other ones aside'" (quoting
Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 117-
118 (1936))); ante, at 314 ("[T]he question is, does a
state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,
actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum
may entertain without disturbing any congressionally
approved balance of federal and state judicial
responsibilities"); ante, at 317, 318 ("`[D]eterminations
about federal jurisdiction require sensitive judgments
about congressional intent, judicial power, and the
federal system'"; "the absence of a federal private right of
action [is] evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of,
the `sensitive judgments about congressional intent' that
§ 1331 requires" (quoting Merrell Dow, supra, at 810)).
Whatever the vices of the American Well Works rule,
it is clear. Moreover, it accounts for the "`vast majority'"
of cases that come within § 1331 under our current case
law, Merrell Dow, supra, at 808 (quoting Franchise Tax
Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for
Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 9 (1983)) — further
indication that trying to sort out which cases fall within
the smaller Smith category may not be worth the effort
it entails. See R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart
and Wechsler's The Federal [545 U.S. 322] Courts and
the Federal System 885-886 (5th ed. 2003). Accordingly,
I would be willing in appropriate circumstances to
reconsider our interpretation of § 1331.
