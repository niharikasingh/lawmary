I agree with Justice SOUTER and join his dissent. I
write separately to point out that, like the Court, I
believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation
from interfering with “the proper execution of the work
of the Government.” Ante, at 1953. But I cannot find in
that need adequate justification for the Court's
interpretation of
[556 U.S. 700] Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all, provides
trial courts with other legal weapons designed to
prevent unwarranted interference. As the Second
Circuit explained, where a Government defendant
asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court,
responsible for managing a case and “mindful of the
need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity
defense,” can structure discovery in ways that diminish
the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public
officials. See Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007). A
district court, for example, can begin discovery with
lower level government defendants before determining
whether a case can be made to allow discovery related to
higher level government officials. See ibid. Neither the
briefs nor the Court's opinion provides convincing
grounds for finding these alternative case-management
tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before
us. For this reason, as well as for the independently
sufficient reasons set forth in Justice SOUTER's
opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.
