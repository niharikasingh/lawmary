I join the Court's opinion and add only a few words to
emphasize a factor I believe is misconceived by the
dissenters. The purpose of the termination proceeding
at issue here was not "punitive." Post, at 48. On the
contrary, its purpose was protective of the child's best
interests. Given the record in this case, which involves
the parental rights of a mother under lengthy sentence
for murder who showed little interest in her son, the
writ might well have been a "candidate" for dismissal as
improvidently granted. See ante, at 32-33. However, I
am content to join the narrow holding of the Court,
leaving the appointment of counsel in termination

 proceedings to be determined by the state courts
on a case-by-case basis.
