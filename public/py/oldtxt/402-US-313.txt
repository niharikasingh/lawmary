Respondent University of Illinois Foundation (hereafter
Foundation) is the owner by assignment of U. S. Patent
No. 3,210,767, issued to Dwight E. Isbell on October 5,
1965. The patent is for "Frequency Independent
Unidirectional Antennas," and Isbell first filed his
application May 3, 1960. The antennas covered are
designed for transmission and reception of
electromagnetic radio frequency signals used in many
types of communications, including the broadcasting of
radio and television signals.
The patent has been much litigated since it was granted,
primarily because it claims a high quality television
antenna for color reception. One of the first
infringement suits brought by the Foundation was filed
in the Southern District of Iowa against the Winegard
Co., an antenna manufacturer. Trial was to the court,
and after pursuing the inquiry mandated by Graham v.
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966), Chief Judge
Stephenson held the patent invalid since "it would have
been obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art and
wishing to design a frequency independent
unidirectional [402 U.S. 315] antenna to combine these
three old elements, all suggested by the prior art
references previously discussed." University of Illinois
Foundation v. Winegard Co., 271 F.Supp. 412, 419 (SD
Iowa 1967) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, he entered
judgment for the alleged infringer and against the
patentee. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit unanimously affirmed Judge Stephenson. 402
F.2d 125 (1968). We denied the patentee's petition for
certiorari. 394 U.S. 917 (1969).
In March 1966, well before Judge Stephenson had ruled
in the Winegard case, the Foundation also filed suit in
the Northern District of Illinois charging a Chicago
customer of petitioner, Blonder-Tongue Laboratories,
Inc. (hereafter B-T), with infringing two patents it
owned by assignment: the Isbell patent and U. S. Patent
No. Re. 25,740, reissued March 9, 1965, to P. E. Mayes
et al. The Mayes patent was entitled "Log Periodic
Backward Wave Antenna Array," and was, as indicated,
a reissue of No. 3,108,280, applied for on September 30,
1960. B-T chose to subject itself to the jurisdiction of the
court to [402 U.S. 316] defend its customer, and it filed
an answer and counterclaim against the Foundation and
its licensee, respondent JFD Electronics Corp., charging:
(1) that both the Isbell and Mayes patents were invalid;
(2) that if those patents were valid, the B-T antennas did
not infringe either of them; (3) that the Foundation and
JFD were guilty of unfair competition; (4) that the
Foundation and JFD had violated the "anti-trust laws of
the United States, including the Sherman and Clayton
Acts, as amended"; and (5) that certain JFD antenna
models infringed B-T's patent No. 3,259,904, "Antenna
Having Combined Support and Lead-In," issued July 5,
1966.
Trial was again to the court, and on June 27, 1968, Judge
Hoffman held that the Foundation's patents were valid
and infringed, dismissed the unfair competition and
antitrust charges, and found claim 5 of the B-T patent
obvious and invalid. Before discussing the Isbell patent
in detail, Judge Hoffman noted that it had been held
invalid as obvious by Judge Stephenson in the Winegard
litigation. He stated:
"This court is, of course, free to decide the case at bar on the basis of
the evidence before it. Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638, 642 (1936).
Although a patent has been adjudged invalid in another patent
infringement action against other defendants, patent owners
cannot be deprived `of the right to show, if they can, that, as against
defendants who have not previously been in court, the patent is
valid and infringed.' Aghnides v. Holden, 22[6] F. 2d 949, 951 (7th
Cir. 1955). On the basis of the evidence before it, this court
disagrees with the conclusion reached in the Winegard case and
finds both the Isbell patent and the Mayes et al. patent valid and
enforceable patents." App. 73.
[402 U.S. 317] B-T appealed, and the Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit affirmed: (1) the findings that
the Isbell patent was both valid and infringed by B-T's
products; (2) the dismissal of B-T's unfair competition
and antitrust counterclaims; and (3) the finding that
claim 5 of the B-T patent was obvious. However, the
Court of Appeals reversed the judgment insofar as Judge
Hoffman had found the Mayes patent valid and
enforceable, enjoined infringement thereof, and
provided damages for such infringement. 422 F.2d 769
(1970).
B-T sought certiorari, assigning the conflict between the
Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Eighth Circuits as
to the validity of the Isbell patent as a primary reason for
granting the writ. We granted certiorari, 400 U.S. 864
(1970), and subsequently requested the parties to discuss
the following additional issues not raised in the petition
for review:
"1. Should the holding of Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638, that a
determination of patent invalidity is not res judicata as against the
patentee in subsequent litigation against a different defendant, be
adhered to?
"2. If not, does the determination of invalidity in the Winegard
litigation bind the respondents in this case?"
I
In Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638 (1936), this Court
held:
"Neither reason nor authority supports the contention that an
adjudication adverse to any or all the claims of a patent precludes
another suit upon the same claims against a different defendant.
While [402 U.S. 318] the earlier decision may by comity be given
great weight in a later litigation and thus persuade the court to
render a like decree, it is not res adjudicata and may not be pleaded
as a defense." 297 U. S., at 642.
The holding in Triplett has been at least gently criticized
by some judges. In its opinion in the instant case, the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recognized the
Triplett rule but nevertheless remarked that it "would
seem sound judicial policy that the adjudication of [the
question of the Isbell patent's validity] against the
Foundation in one action where it was a party would
provide a defense in any other action by the Foundation
for infringement of the same patent." 422 F. 2d, at 772.
[402 U.S. 319] In its brief here, the Foundation urges
that the rule of Triplett be maintained. Petitioner B-T's
brief took the same position, stating that "[t]hough
petitioners stand to gain by any such result, we cannot
urge the destruction of a long-accepted safeguard for
patentees merely for the expediency of victory." Brief for
Petitioner 12. The Government, however, appearing as
amicus curiae, urges that Triplett was based on
uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of mutuality of
estoppel, since limited significantly, and that the time
has come to modify Triplett so that "claims of estoppel
in patent cases [are] considered on a case by case basis,
giving due weight to any factors which would point to
an unfair or anomalous result from their allowance."
Brief for the United States 7. The Government's
position was spelled out in a brief filed more than a
month after petitioner B-T filed its brief.
At oral argument the following colloquy occurred
between the Court and counsel for B-T:
"Q. You're not asking for Triplett to be overruled?
"A. No, I'm not. I maintain that my brother here did have a right if
there was a genuine new issue or some other interpretation of the
[patent] claim or some interpretation of law in another circuit
that's different than this Circuit, he had a right to try, under
Triplett below, in another circuit.
"In this particular case, where we're stuck with substantially the
same documentary evidence, where we were not able to produce
[in the Seventh Circuit] even that modicum of expert testimony
that existed in the Eighth Circuit, we think there may be as
suggested by the Solicitor General, some reason for modification of
that document [sic] in a case such as this." Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8.
[402 U.S. 320] In light of this change of attitude from
the time petitioner's brief was filed, we consider that the
question of modifying Triplett is properly before us.
II
Triplett v. Lowell exemplified the judge-made doctrine
of mutuality of estoppel, ordaining that unless both
parties (or their privies) in a second action are bound by
a judgment in a previous case, neither party (nor his
privy) in the second action may use the prior judgment
as determinative [402 U.S. 321] of an issue in the second
action. Triplett was decided in 1936. The opinion stated
that "the rules of the common law applicable to
successive litigations concerning the same subject
matter" did not preclude "relitigation of the validity of a
patent claim previously held invalid in a suit against a
different defendant." 297 U. S., at 644. In Bigelow v. Old
Dominion Copper Co., 225 U.S. 111, 127 (1912), the
Court had stated that it was "a principle of general
elementary law that the estoppel of a judgment must be
mutual." The same [402 U.S. 322] rule was reflected in
the Restatement of Judgments. Restatement of
Judgments § 93 (1942).
But even at the time Triplett was decided, and certainly
by the time the Restatement was published, the
mutuality rule had been under fire. Courts had discarded
the requirement of mutuality and held that only the
party against whom the plea of estoppel was asserted
had to have been in privity with a party in the prior
action. As Judge Friendly has noted, Bentham had
attacked [402 U.S. 323] the doctrine "as destitute of any
semblance of reason, and as `a maxim which one would
suppose to have found its way from the gaming-table to
the bench' . . . ." Zdanok v. Glidden Co., 327 F.2d 944,
954 (CA2 1964), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 934 (1964)
(quoting 3 J. Bentham, Rationale of Judicial Evidence
579 (1827), reprinted in 7 Works of Jeremy Bentham
171 (J. Bowring ed. 1843)). There was also ferment in
scholarly quarters.
Building upon the authority cited above, the California
Supreme Court, in Bernhard v. Bank of America Nat.
Trust & Savings Assn., 19 Cal.2d 807, 122 P.2d 892
(1942), unanimously rejected the doctrine of mutuality,
stating that there was "no compelling reason . . . for
requiring that the party asserting the plea of res judicata
must have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the
earlier litigation." Id., at 812, 122 P. 2d, at 894. Justice
Traynor's opinion, handed down the same year the
Restatement was published, listed criteria since
employed by many courts in many contexts:
"In determining the validity of a plea of res judicata three questions
are pertinent: Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication
identical with the one presented in the action in question? Was
there a final judgment on the merits? Was the party against whom
the plea is asserted a party or in [402 U.S. 324] privity with a party
to the prior adjudication?" 19 Cal. 2d, at 813, 122 P. 2d, at 895.
Although the force of the mutuality rule had been
diminished by exceptions and Bernhard itself might
easily have been brought within one of the established
exceptions, "Justice Traynor chose instead to extirpate
the mutuality requirement and put it to the torch."
Currie, Civil Procedure: The Tempest Brews, 53 Calif.
L. Rev. 25, 26 (1965).
Bernhard had significant impact. Many state and federal
courts rejected the mutuality requirement, especially
where the prior judgment was invoked defensively in a
second action against a plaintiff bringing suit on an issue
he litigated and lost as plaintiff in a prior action. The
trend has been apparent in federal-question cases. The
federal courts found Bernhard persuasive. As Judge
Hastie stated more than 20 years ago:
"This second effort to prove negligence is comprehended by the
generally accepted precept that a party who has had one fair and full
opportunity to prove a claim and has failed in that effort, should
not be permitted to go to trial on the merits of that claim a second
time. Both orderliness and reasonable time saving in judicial
administration require that [402 U.S. 325] this be so unless some
overriding consideration of fairness to a litigant dictates a different
result in the circumstances of a particular case.
"The countervailing consideration urged here is lack of mutuality of
estoppel. In the present suit [the plaintiff] would not have been
permitted to take advantage of an earlier affirmative finding of
negligence, had such finding been made in [his first suit against a
different defendant]. For that reason he argues that he should not
be bound by a contrary finding in that case. But a finding of
negligence in the [plaintiff's first suit] would not have been binding
against the [defendant in a second suit] because [that defendant]
had no opportunity to contest the issue there. The finding of no
negligence on the other hand was made after full opportunity to
[plaintiff] on his own election to prove the very matter which he
now urges a second time. Thus, no unfairness results here from
estoppel which is not mutual. In reality the argument of [plaintiff]
is merely that the application of res judicata in this case makes the
law asymmetrical. But the achievement of substantial justice rather
than symmetry is the measure of the fairness of the rules of res
judicata." Bruszewski v. United States, 181 F.2d 419, 421 (CA3
1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 865 (1950).
Many federal courts, exercising both federal question
and diversity jurisdiction, are in accord unless in a
diversity case bound to apply a conflicting state rule
requiring mutuality.
[402 U.S. 326] Of course, transformation of estoppel law
was neither instantaneous nor universal. As late as 1961,
eminent authority stated that "[m]ost state courts
recognize and apply the doctrine of mutuality, subject to
certain exceptions. . . . And the same is true of federal
courts, when free to apply their own doctrine." Moore &
Currier, Mutuality and Conclusiveness of Judgments, 35
Tul. L. Rev. 301, 304 (1961) (footnotes omitted); see
also, 1B J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 0.412 [1], pp. 1803-
1804 (1965). However, in 1970 Professor Moore noted
that "the trend in the federal courts is away from the
rigid requirements of mutuality advocated herein." Id.,
Supp. 1970, at 53. The same trend is evident in the state
courts.
[402 U.S. 327] Undeniably, the court-produced doctrine
of mutuality of estoppel is undergoing fundamental
change in the common-law tradition. In its pristine
formulation, an increasing number of courts have
rejected the principle as unsound. Nor is it irrelevant
that the abrogation of mutuality has been accompanied
by other developments —such as expansion of the
definition of "claim" in bar and merger contexts and
expansion of the preclusive effects afforded criminal
judgments in civil litigation — which enhance the
capabilities of the courts to deal with some issues swiftly
but fairly.
Obviously, these mutations in estoppel doctrine are not
before us for wholesale approval or rejection. But at the
very least they counsel us to re-examine whether
mutuality of estoppel is a viable rule where a patentee
seeks to relitigate the validity of a patent once a federal
court has declared it to be invalid.
[402 U.S. 328] III
The cases and authorities discussed above connect
erosion of the mutuality requirement to the goal of
limiting relitigation of issues where that can be achieved
without compromising fairness in particular cases. The
courts have often discarded the rule while commenting
on crowded dockets and long delays preceding trial.
Authorities differ on whether the public interest in
efficient judicial administration is a sufficient ground in
and of itself for abandoning mutuality, but it is clear
that more than crowded dockets is involved. The
broader question is whether it is any longer tenable to
afford a litigant more than one full and fair opportunity
for judicial resolution of the same issue. The question in
these terms includes as part of the calculus the effect on
judicial administration, but it also encompasses the
concern exemplified by Bentham's reference to the
gaming table in his attack on the principle of mutuality
of estoppel. [402 U.S. 329] In any lawsuit where a
defendant, because of the mutuality principle, is forced
to present a complete defense on the merits to a claim
which the plaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior
action, there is an arguable misallocation of resources.
To the extent the defendant in the second suit may not
win by asserting, without contradiction, that the
plaintiff had fully and fairly, but unsuccessfully, litigated
the same claim in the prior suit, the defendant's time
and money are diverted from alternative
uses—productive or otherwise—to relitigation of a
decided issue. And, still assuming that the issue was
resolved correctly in the first suit, there is reason to be
concerned about the plaintiff's allocation of resources.
Permitting repeated litigation of the same issue as long
as the supply of unrelated defendants holds out reflects
either the aura of the gaming table or "a lack of
discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the
lower courts, hardly a worthy or wise basis for
fashioning rules of procedure." Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. CO-Two
Co., 342 U.S. 180, 185 (1952). Although neither
judges, the parties, nor the adversary system performs
perfectly in all cases, the requirement of determining
whether the party against whom an estoppel is asserted
had a full and fair opportunity to litigate is a most
significant safeguard.
Some litigants—those who never appeared in a prior
action—may not be collaterally estopped without
litigating the issue. They have never had a chance to
present their evidence and arguments on the claim. Due
process prohibits estopping them despite one or more
existing adjudications of the identical issue which stand
squarely against their position. See Hansberry v. Lee,
311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940); Bernhard, 19 Cal. 2d, at 811, 122
P. 2d, at 894. Also, the authorities have been more
willing to permit a defendant in a second suit to invoke
an estoppel against a plaintiff who lost on the same
claim in an earlier suit than they have been to allow a
plaintiff [402 U.S. 330] in the second suit to use
offensively a judgment obtained by a different plaintiff
in a prior suit against the same defendant. But the case
before us involves neither due process nor "offensive
use" questions. Rather, it depends on the considerations
weighing for and against permitting a patent holder to
sue on his patent after it has once been held invalid
following opportunity for full and fair trial.
There are several components of the problem. First, we
analyze the proposed abrogation or modification of the
Triplett rule in terms of those considerations relevant to
the patent system. Second, we deal broadly with the
economic costs of continued adherence to Triplett.
Finally, we explore the nature of the burden, if any, that
permitting patentees to relitigate patents once held
invalid imposes on the federal courts.
A
Starting with the premise that the statutes creating the
patent system, expressly sanctioned by the
Constitution, represent an affirmative policy choice by
Congress to reward inventors, respondents extrapolate a
special public interest in sustaining "good" patents and
characterize patent litigation as so technical and difficult
as to present unusual potential for unsound
adjudications. Although Triplett made no such
argument in support of its holding, that rule, offering
the unrestricted right to [402 U.S. 331] relitigate patent
validity, is thus deemed an essential safeguard against
improvident judgments of invalidity.
We fully accept congressional judgment to reward
inventors through the patent system. We are also aware
that some courts have frankly stated that patent
litigation can present issues so complex that legal minds,
without appropriate grounding in science and
technology, may have difficulty in reaching decision.
On the other hand, this Court has observed that issues
of nonobviousness under 35 U. S. C. § 103 present
difficulties "comparable to those encountered daily by
the courts in such frames of reference as negligence and
scienter, and should be amenable to a case-by-case
development." Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U. S., at
18. But assuming a patent case so difficult as to provoke
a frank admission of judicial uncertainty, one might ask
what reason there is to expect that a second district
judge or court of [402 U.S. 332] appeals would be able to
decide the issue more accurately. Moreover, as Graham
also indicates, Congress has from the outset chosen to
impose broad criteria of patentability while lodging in
the federal courts final authority to decide that question.
383 U. S., at 10. In any event it cannot be sensibly
contended that all issues concerning patent validity are
so complex and unyielding. Nonobviousness itself is not
always difficult to perceive and decide and other
questions on which patentability depends are more
often than not no more difficult than those encountered
in the usual nonpatent case.
Even conceding the extreme intricacy of some patent
cases, we should keep firmly in mind that we are
considering the situation where the patentee was
plaintiff in the prior suit and chose to litigate at that
time and place. Presumably he was prepared to litigate
and to litigate to the finish against the defendant there
involved. Patent litigation characteristically proceeds
with some deliberation and, with the avenues for
discovery available under the present rules of procedure,
there is no reason to suppose that plaintiff patentees
would face either surprise or unusual difficulties in
getting all relevant and probative evidence before the
court in the first litigation.
Moreover, we do not suggest, without legislative
guidance, that a plea of estoppel by an infringement or
[402 U.S. 333] royalty suit defendant must automatically
be accepted once the defendant in support of his plea
identifies the issue in suit as the identical question finally
decided against the patentee or one of his privies in
previous litigation. Rather, the patentee-plaintiff must
be permitted to demonstrate, if he can, that he did not
have "a fair opportunity procedurally, substantively and
evidentially to pursue his claim the first time." Eisel v.
Columbia Packing Co., 181 F.Supp. 298, 301 (Mass.
1960). This element in the estoppel decision will
comprehend, we believe, the important concerns about
the complexity of patent litigation and the posited
hazard that the prior proceedings were seriously
defective.
Determining whether a patentee has had a full and fair
chance to litigate the validity of his patent in an earlier
case is of necessity not a simple matter. In addition to
the considerations of choice of forum and incentive to
litigate mentioned above, certain other factors
immediately emerge. For example, if the issue is
nonobviousness, appropriate inquiries would be
whether the first validity determination purported to
employ the standards announced in Graham v. John
Deere Co., supra; whether the opinions filed by the
District Court and the reviewing court, if any, indicate
that the prior case was one of those relatively rare
instances where the courts wholly failed to grasp the
technical subject matter and issues in suit; and whether
without fault of his own the patentee was deprived of
crucial evidence or witness in the first litigation. But as
so often is the case, no one [402 U.S. 334] set of facts, no
one collection of words or phrases, will provide an
automatic formula for proper rulings on estoppel pleas.
In the end, decision will necessarily rest on the trial
courts' sense of justice and equity.
We are not persuaded, therefore, that the Triplett rule,
as it was formulated, is essential to effectuate the
purposes of the patent system or is an indispensable or
even an effective safeguard against faulty trials and
judgments. Whatever legitimate concern there may be
about the intricacies of some patent suits, it is
insufficient in and of itself to justify patentees
relitigating validity issues as long as new defendants are
available. This is especially true if the court in the
second litigation must decide in a principled way
whether or not it is just and equitable to allow the plea
of estoppel in the case before it.
B
An examination of the economic consequences of
continued adherence to Triplett has two branches. Both,
however, begin with the acknowledged fact that patent
litigation is a very costly process. Judge Frank observed
in 1942 that "the expense of defending a patent suit is
often staggering to the small businessman." Picard v.
United Aircraft Corp., 128 F.2d 632, 641 (CA2 1942)
(concurring opinion). In Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S.
653, 669 (1969), we noted that one of the benefits
accruing to a businessman accepting a license from a
patentee who was threatening him with a suit was
avoiding "the necessity of defending an expensive
infringement action during the period when he may be
least able to afford one." Similarly, in replying to claims
by alleged [402 U.S. 335] infringers that they have been
guilty of laches in suing on their patents, patentees have
claimed that the expense of litigating forced them to
postpone bringing legal action. See, e. g., Baker Mfg. Co.
v. Whitewater Mfg. Co., 430 F.2d 1008, 1014-1015
(CA7 1970). In recent congressional hearings on
revision of the patent laws, a lawyer-businessman
discussing a proposal of the American Society of
Inventors for government-sponsored insurance to
provide funds for litigation to individual inventors
holding nonassigned patents stated: "We are advised
that the average cost for litigating a patent is about
$50,000."
This statement, and arguments such as the one made in
Baker Mfg., supra, must be assessed in light of the fact
that they are advanced by patentees contemplating
action as plaintiffs, and patentees are heavily favored as
a class of litigants by the patent statute. Section 282 of
the Patent Code provides, in pertinent part:
"A patent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing
invalidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it."
If a patentee's expense is high though he enjoys the
benefits of the presumption of validity, the defendant in
an infringement suit will have even higher costs as he
both introduces proof to overcome the presumption and
attempts to rebut whatever proof the patentee offers to
bolster the claims. In testimony before the Senate
subcommittee considering patent law revision in 1967, a
member of the President's Commission on the Patent
[402 U.S. 336] System discussed the financial burden
looming before one charged as a defendant in a complex
infringement action in terms of amounts that sometimes
run to "hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Statistics tend to bear this out. Patent suits constitute
between 1% and 2% of the total number of civil cases
filed each year in the District Courts. Despite this
relatively small figure, and notwithstanding the
overwhelming tendency to try these suits without
juries, [402 U.S. 337] patent cases that go to trial seem
to take an inordinate amount of trial time. While in
1961 a Senate staff report stated that the "typical patent
trial, without a jury, was completed in 3 days or less,"
recent figures indicate that this description of the time
required is today [402 U.S. 338] inaccurate. And
time—particularly trial time—is unquestionably
expensive.
As stated at the outset of this section, the expense of
patent litigation has two principal consequences if the
Triplett rule is maintained. First, assuming that a
perfectly sound judgment of invalidity has been
rendered in an earlier suit involving the patentee, a
second infringement action raising the same issue and
involving much of the same proof has a high cost to the
individual parties. The patentee is expending funds on
litigation to protect a patent which is by hypothesis
invalid. These moneys could be put to better use, such as
further research and development. The alleged
infringer—operating as he must against the presumption
of validity—is forced to divert substantial funds to
litigation that is wasteful.
The second major economic consideration is far more
significant. Under Triplett, only the comity restraints
flowing from an adverse prior judgment operate to limit
the patentee's right to sue different defendants on the
same patent. In each successive suit the patentee enjoys
the statutory presumption of validity, and so may easily
put the alleged infringer to his expensive proof. As a
consequence, prospective defendants will often decide
that paying royalties under a license or other settlement
is preferable to the costly burden of challenging the
patent.
[402 U.S. 339] The problem has surfaced and drawn
comment before. See, e. g., Nickerson v. Kutschera, 419
F.2d 983, 988 n. 4 (CA3 1969) (dissenting opinion);
Picard v. United Aircraft Corp., 128 F. 2d, at 641-642
(concurring opinion). In 1961, the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights
published a staff study of infringement and declaratory
judgment actions terminated in the district courts and
courts of appeals during 1949-1958; the report showed
62 actions commenced after an earlier determination
that the patent in suit was not valid. It also noted that
the "vast majority" of such suits were terminated
without a second adjudication of validity. 1961 Staff
Report 19. It is apparent that termination without a
second adjudication of validity was the result of a
licensing agreement or some other settlement between
the parties to the second suit. It is also important to
recognize that this study covered only cases filed and
terminated; there were undoubtedly more suits that
were threatened but not filed, because the threat alone
was sufficient to forestall a challenge to the patent.
This is borne out by the observations of the President's
Commission on the Patent System and recent testimony
on proposals for changes in the patent laws. Motivated
by the economic consequences of repetitious patent
litigation, the Commission proposed:
"A final federal judicial determination declaring a patent claim
invalid shall be in rem, and the cancellation of such claim shall be
indicated on all patent copies subsequently distributed by the Patent
Office." Recommendation XXIII, Commission Report 38.
The Commission stressed the competitive disadvantage
imposed on an alleged infringer who is unable or
unwilling to defend a suit on the patent, stating also that
a "patentee, having been afforded the opportunity to
[402 U.S. 340] exhaust his remedy of appeal from a
holding of invalidity, has had his `day in court' and
should not be allowed to harass others on the basis of an
invalid claim. There are few, if any, logical grounds for
permitting him to clutter crowded court dockets and to
subject others to costly litigation." Id., at 39. The report
provoked the introduction of several bills to effect broad
changes in the patent system. Some bills contained
provisions imposing an inflexible rule of in rem
invalidity operating against a patentee regardless of the
character of the litigation in which his patent was first
declared invalid. See S. 1042, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., § 294
(1967), and H. R. 5924, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., § 294
(1967); cf. [402 U.S. 341] S. 3892, 90th Cong., 2d Sess.,
§ 294 (1968). Hearings were held in both Houses on
these and other patent revision bills.
[402 U.S. 342] In the Senate hearings, a member of the
President's Commission remarked:
"The businessman can be subjected to considerable harassment as
an alleged infringer. Even in cases where he feels strongly that the
patent would ultimately be held invalid, when he considers the
hundreds of thousands of dollars in complex cases that could be
involved in defending a suit, he may conclude that the best course
of action is to settle for less to get rid of the problem. These
nuisance settlements, although distasteful, are often, under the
present system, justified on pure economics.
.....
"In many instances the very survival of the small businessman may
be at stake. His cost of fully litigating a claim against him can
seriously impair his ability to stay in business." 1967 Senate
Hearings 103.
The tendency of Triplett to multiply the opportunities
for holders of invalid patents to exact licensing
agreements or other settlements from alleged infringers
must [402 U.S. 343] be considered in the context of
other decisions of this Court. Although recognizing the
patent system's desirable stimulus to invention, we have
also viewed the patent as a monopoly which, although
sanctioned by law, has the economic consequences
attending other monopolies. A patent yielding returns
for a device that fails to meet the congressionally
imposed criteria of patentability is anomalous. This
Court has observed:
"A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. . . . [It]
is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the
right to access to a free and open market. The far-reaching social
and economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give the public a
paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from
backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable conduct and that
such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope." Precision
Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.,
324 U.S. 806, 816 (1945).
One obvious manifestation of this principle has been the
series of decisions in which the Court has condemned
attempts to broaden the physical or temporal scope of
the patent monopoly. As stated in Mercoid v.
MidContinent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661, 666
(1944):
"The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any
use of the monopoly of the patent [402 U.S. 344] to create another
monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a
license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent
by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v.
Masonite Corp., [316 U.S. 265,] 277 [(1942)]. The method by
which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. United
States v. Univis Lens Co., [316 U.S. 241,] 251-252 [(1942)]. The
patent is a privilege. But it is a privilege which is conditioned by a
public purpose. It results from invention and is limited to the
invention which it defines."
A second group of authorities encourage authoritative
testing of patent validity. In 1952, the Court indicated
that a manufacturer of a device need not await the filing
of an infringement action in order to test the validity of
a competitor's patent, but may institute his own suit
under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Kerotest Mfg. Co.
v. C-O-Two Co., 342 U. S., at 185-186. Other [402
U.S. 345] decisions of this type involved removal of
restrictions on those who would challenge the validity
of patents.
Two Terms ago in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653
(1969), we relied on both lines of authority to abrogate
the doctrine that in a contract action for unpaid patent
royalties the licensee of a patent is estopped from
proving "that his licensor was demanding royalties for
the use of an idea which was in reality a part of the
public domain." 395 U. S., at 656. The principle that
"federal law requires that all ideas in general circulation
be dedicated to the common good unless they are
protected by a valid patent," 395 U. S., at 668, found
support in Sears and Compco and the first line of cases
discussed above. The holding that licensee estoppel
was no longer tenable was rooted in the second line of
cases eliminating obstacles to suit by those disposed to
challenge the validity of a patent. 395 U. S., at 663-668.
Moreover, as indicated earlier, we relied on practical
considerations that patent licensees "may often be the
only individuals with enough economic incentive to
challenge the patentability of an inventor's discovery."
395 U. S., at 670.
To be sure, Lear obviates to some extent the concern
that Triplett prompts alleged infringers to pay royalties
on patents previously declared invalid rather than to
engage in costly litigation when infringement suits are
[402 U.S. 346] threatened. Lear permits an accused
infringer to accept a license, pay royalties for a time, and
cease paying when financially able to litigate validity,
secure in the knowledge that invalidity may be urged
when the patentee-licensor sues for unpaid royalties.
Nevertheless, if the claims are in fact invalid and are
identical to those invalidated in a previous suit against
another party, any royalties actually paid are an unjust
increment to the alleged infringer's costs. Those
payments put him at a competitive disadvantage vis-à
-vis other alleged infringers who can afford to litigate or
have successfully litigated the patent's validity.
This has several economic consequences. First, the
alleged infringer who cannot afford to defend may
absorb the royalty costs in order to compete with other
manufacturers who have secured holdings that the
patent is invalid, cutting the profitability of his business
and perhaps assuring that he will never be in a financial
position to challenge the patent in court. On the other
hand, the manufacturer who has secured a judicial
holding that the patent is invalid may be able to increase
his market share substantially, and he may do so without
coming close to the price levels that would prevail in a
competitive market. Because he is free of royalty
payments, the manufacturer with a judgment against the
patent may price his products higher than competitive
levels absent the invalid patent, yet just below the levels
set by those manufacturers who must pay royalties.
Third, consumers will pay higher prices for goods
covered by the invalid patent than would be true had the
initial ruling of invalidity had at least the potential for
broader effect. And even if the alleged infringer can
escape royalty obligations under Lear when he is able to
bear the cost of litigation, any royalty payments passed
on to consumers are as a practical matter unrecoverable
by those who in fact paid them. Beyond all of this, the
[402 U.S. 347] rule of Triplett may permit invalid
patents to serve almost as effectively as would valid
patents as barriers to the entry of new
firms—particularly small firms.
Economic consequences like these, to the extent that
they can be avoided, weigh in favor of modification of
the Triplett mutuality principle. Arguably, however, the
availability of estoppel to one charged with
infringement of a patent previously held invalid will
merely shift the focus of litigation from the merits of the
dispute to the question whether the party to be estopped
had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claim in the
first action. Moore & Currier, supra, n. 7, at 309-310. It
would seem sufficient answer to note that once it is
determined that the issue in both actions was identical,
it will be easier to decide whether there was a full
opportunity to determine that issue in the first action
than it would be to relitigate completely the question of
validity. And, this does not in fact seem to have been a
problem in other contexts, where strict mutuality of
estoppel has been abandoned.
It has also been suggested that 35 U. S. C. § 285, which
allows a court to award reasonable attorney's fees to a
prevailing party "in exceptional cases," and 35 U. S. C.
§ 288, under which a patentee forfeits his right to
recover costs even as to the valid claims of his patent if
he does not disclaim invalid claims before bringing suit,
work to inhibit repetitious suits on invalid patents. But
neither of these provisions can operate until after
litigation has occurred, and the outlay required to try a
lawsuit presenting validity issues is the factor which
undoubtedly forces many alleged infringers into
accepting [402 U.S. 348] licenses rather than litigating. If
concern about such license agreements is proper, as our
cases indicate that it is, the accused infringer should
have available an estoppel defense that can be pleaded
affirmatively and determined on a pretrial motion for
judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment. Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc. 8 (c), 12 (c), and 56.

As the preceding discussion indicates, although patent
trials are only a small portion of the total amount of
litigation in the federal courts, they tend to be of
disproportionate length. Despite this, respondents
urge that the burden on the federal courts from
relitigation of patents once held invalid is de minimis.
They rely on the figures presented in the 1961 Staff
Report: during the period 1948-1959, 62 federal suits
were terminated which involved relitigation of a patent
previously held invalid, a figure constituting about 1% of
the patent suits commenced during the same period.
The same figures show that these 62 suits involved 27
patents, indicating that some patentees sue more than
once after their patent has been invalidated.
Respondents also urge that most of these 62 suits were
settled without litigation. 1961 Staff Report 19. But, as
we have suggested, this fact cuts both ways.
Even accepting respondents' characterization of these
figures as de minimis, it is clear that abrogation of
Triplett will save some judicial time if even a few
relatively lengthy patent suits may be fairly disposed of
on pleas of estoppel. More fundamentally, while the
cases do discuss reduction in dockets as an effect of
elimination of the mutuality requirement, they do not
purport to hold that predictions about the actual
amount of judicial time that will be saved under such a
holding control decision [402 U.S. 349] of that question.
Of course, we have no comparable figures for the past
decade concerning suits begun after one declaration of
invalidity, although a number of recent, significant
examples of repeated litigation of the same patent have
come to our attention. Regardless of the magnitude of
the figures, the economic consequences of continued
adherence to Triplett are serious and any reduction of
litigation in this context is by comparison an incidental
matter in considering whether to abrogate the mutuality
requirement.

It is clear that judicial decisions have tended to depart
from the rigid requirements of mutuality. In accordance
with this trend, there has been a corresponding
development of the lower courts' ability and facility in
dealing with questions of when it is appropriate and fair
to impose an estoppel against a party who has already
litigated an issue once and lost. As one commentator has
stated:
"Under the tests of time and subsequent developments, the
Bernhard decision has proved its merit and the mettle of its author.
The abrasive action of new factual configurations and of actual
human controversies, disposed of in the common-law tradition by
competent courts, far more than the commentaries of academicians,
leaves the decision revealed for what it is, as it was written: a
shining landmark of progress in justice and law administration."
Currie, 53 Calif. L. Rev., at 37.
When these judicial developments are considered in the
light of our consistent view—last presented in Lear, Inc.
v. Adkins—that the holder of a patent should not be
insulated from the assertion of defenses and thus
allowed [402 U.S. 350] to exact royalties for the use of an
idea that is not in fact patentable or that is beyond the
scope of the patent monopoly granted, it is apparent that
the uncritical acceptance of the principle of mutuality of
estoppel expressed in Triplett v. Lowell is today out of
place. Thus, we conclude that Triplett should be
overruled to the extent it forecloses a plea of estoppel by
one facing a charge of infringement of a patent that has
once been declared invalid.
IV
Res judicata and collateral estoppel are affirmative
defenses that must be pleaded. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8 (c).
The purpose of such pleading is to give the opposing
party notice of the plea of estoppel and a chance to
argue, if he can, why the imposition of an estoppel
would be inappropriate. Because of Triplett v. Lowell,
petitioner did not plead estoppel and respondents never
had an opportunity to challenge the appropriateness of
such a plea on the grounds set forth in Part III-A of this
opinion. Therefore, given the partial overruling of
Triplett, we remand the case. Petitioner should be
allowed to amend its pleadings in the District Court to
assert a plea of estoppel. Respondents must then be
permitted to amend their pleadings, and to supplement
the record with any evidence showing why an estoppel
should not be imposed in this case. If necessary,
petitioner may also supplement the record. In taking
this action, we intimate no views on the other issues
presented in this case. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
