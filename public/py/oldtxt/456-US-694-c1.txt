The Court rests today's decision on a constitutional
distinction between "subject matter" and "in personam"
jurisdiction. Under this distinction, subject-matter
jurisdiction defines an Art. III limitation on the power
of federal courts. By contrast, the Court characterizes
the limits on in personam jurisdiction solely in terms of
waivable personal rights and notions of "fair play."
Having done so, it determines [456 U.S. 710] that
fundamental questions of judicial power do not arise in
this case concerning the personal jurisdiction of a
federal district court.
In my view the Court's broadly theoretical decision
misapprehends the issues actually presented for
decision. Federal courts are courts of limited
jurisdiction. Their personal jurisdiction, no less than
their subject-matter jurisdiction, is subject both to
constitutional and to statutory definition. When the
applicable limitations on federal jurisdiction are
identified, it becomes apparent that the Court's theory
could require a sweeping but largely unexplicated
revision of jurisdictional doctrine. This revision could
encompass not only the personal jurisdiction of federal
courts but "sovereign" limitations on state jurisdiction as
identified in World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.
Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291-293 (1980). Fair resolution
of this case does not require the Court's broad holding.
Accordingly, although I concur in the Court's judgment,
I cannot join its opinion.

This lawsuit began when the respondent Compagnie des
Bauxites brought a contract action against the petitioner
insurance companies in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Alleging
diversity jurisdiction, respondent averred that the
District Court had personal jurisdiction of the
petitioners, all foreign corporations, under the long-arm
statute of the State of Pennsylvania. See Compagnie des
Bauxites de Guinea v. Insurance Co. of North America,
651 F.2d 877, 880-881 (CA3 1981). Petitioners,
however, denied that they were subject to the court's
personal jurisdiction under that or any other statute.
Viewing the question largely as one of fact, the court
ordered discovery to resolve the dispute.
Meantime, while respondent unsuccessfully sought
compliance with its discovery requests, petitioners
brought a parallel action in England's High Court of
Justice, Queens Bench [456 U.S. 711] Division. It was at
this juncture that the current issues arose. Seeking to
enjoin the English proceedings, respondent sought an
injunction in the District Court. Petitioners protested
that they were not subject to that court's personal
jurisdiction and thus that they lay beyond its injunctive
powers. But the District Court disagreed. As a
jurisdictional prerequisite to its entry of the injunction,
the court upheld its personal jurisdiction over
petitioners.1 It characterized its finding of jurisdiction
partly as a sanction for petitioners' noncompliance with
its discovery orders under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 37(b).2
Rule 37(b) is not, however, a jurisdictional provision. As
recognized by the Court of Appeals, the governing
jurisdictional statute remains the long-arm statute of the
State of Pennsylvania. See 651 F. 2d, at 881. In my view
the Court fails to make clear the implications of this
central fact: that the District Court in this case relied on
state law to obtain personal jurisdiction.
As courts of limited jurisdiction, the federal district
courts possess no warrant to create jurisdictional law of
their own. Under the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1652, they must apply state law "except where the
Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of
Congress otherwise require or provide . . . ." See
generally Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).
Thus, in the absence of a federal rule or statute
establishing a federal basis for the assertion of personal
jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction of the district
courts is determined in diversity cases by the law of the
forum State. See, e. g., Intermeat, Inc. v. American
Poultry Co., 575 F.2d 1017 (CA2 1978); Wilkerson v.
Fortuna Corp., 554 F.2d 745 (CA5),[456 U.S. 712] cert.
denied, 434 U.S. 939 (1977); Poyner v. Erma Werke
Gmbh, 618 F.2d 1186, 1187 (CA6 1980); Lakeside
Bridge & Steel Co. v. Mountain State Constr. Co., 597
F.2d 596 (CA7 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 907 (1980);
Lakota Girl Scout Council, Inc. v. Havey Fundraising
Management, Inc., 519 F.2d 634 (CA8 1975);
Arrowsmith v. United Press International, 320 F.2d 219,
226 (CA2 1963); Forsythe v. Overmyer, 576 F.2d 779,
782 (CA9), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 864 (1978); Quarles v.
Fuqua Industries, Inc., 504 F.2d 1358 (CA10 1974).3
As a result of the District Court's dependence on the law
of Pennsylvania to establish personal jurisdiction — a
dependence mandated by Congress under 28 U. S. C. §
1652 — its jurisdiction in this case normally would be
subject to the same due process limitations as a state
court. See, e. g., Forsythe v. Overmyer, supra, at 782;
Washington v. Norton Mfg., Inc., 588 F.2d 441, 445
(CA5 1979); Fisons Ltd. v. United States, 458 F.2d 1241,
1250 (CA7 1972).4 Thus, the question arises how today's
decision is related to cases restricting the personal
jurisdiction of the States.
Before today our decisions had established that
"minimum contacts" represented a constitutional
prerequisite to the exercise of in personam jurisdiction
over an unconsenting defendant. See, e. g., World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S., at 291-
293;[456 U.S. 713] Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251
(1958); International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S.
310, 316 (1945). In the absence of a showing of
minimum contacts, a finding of personal jurisdiction
over an unconsenting defendant, even as a sanction,
therefore would appear to transgress previously
established constitutional limitations. The cases cannot
be reconciled by a simple distinction between the
constitutional limits on state and federal courts. Because
of the District Court's reliance on the Pennsylvania
long-arm statute — the applicable jurisdictional
provision under the Rules of Decisions Act — the
relevant constitutional limits would not be those
imposed directly on federal courts by the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but those applicable to
state jurisdictional law under the Fourteenth.
The Court's decision apparently must be understood as
related to our state jurisdictional cases in one of two
ways. Both involve legal theories that fail to justify the
doctrine adopted by the Court in this case.
A
Under traditional principles, the due process question in
this case is whether "minimum contacts" exist between
petitioners and the forum State that would justify the
State in exercising personal jurisdiction. See, e. g.,
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, at
291-293; Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 216 (1977);
Hanson v. Denckla, supra, at 251. By finding that the
establishment of minimum contacts is not a prerequisite
to the exercise of jurisdiction to impose sanctions under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, the Court may be
understood as finding that "minimum contacts" no
longer are a constitutional requirement for the exercise
by a state court of personal jurisdiction over an
unconsenting defendant.5 Whenever the Court's
notions [456 U.S. 714] of fairness are not offended,
jurisdiction apparently may be upheld.
Before today, of course, our cases had linked minimum
contacts and fair play as jointly defining the "sovereign"
limits on state assertions of personal jurisdiction over
unconsenting defendants. See World-Wide Volkswagen
Corp. v. Woodson, supra, at 292-293; see Hanson v.
Denckla, supra, at 251. The Court appears to abandon
the rationale of these cases in a footnote. See ante, at
702-703, n. 10. But it does not address the implications
of its action. By eschewing reliance on the concept of
minimum contacts as a "sovereign" limitation on the
power of States — for, again, it is the State's long-arm
statute that is invoked to obtain personal jurisdiction in
the District Court — the Court today effects a potentially
substantial change of law. For the first time it defines
personal jurisdiction solely by reference to abstract
notions of fair play. And, astonishingly to me, it does so
in a case in which this rationale for decision was neither
argued nor briefed by the parties.
B
Alternatively, it is possible to read the Court opinion,
not as affecting state jurisdiction, but simply as asserting
that Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
represents a congressionally approved basis for the
exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal district
court. On this view Rule 37 vests the federal district
courts with authority to take jurisdiction over persons
not in compliance with discovery orders. This of course
would be a more limited holding. Yet the Court does
not cast its decision in these terms. And it provides no
support for such an interpretation, either in the
language or in the history of the Federal Rules.
[456 U.S. 715] In the absence of such support, I could not
join the Court in embracing such a construction of the
Rules of Civil Procedure.6 There is nothing in Rule 37
to suggest that it is intended to confer a grant of
personal jurisdiction. Indeed, the clear language of Rule
82 seems to establish that Rule 37 should not be
construed as a jurisdictional grant: "These rules shall not
be construed to extend . . . the jurisdiction of the United
States district courts or the venue of actions therein."
Moreover, assuming that minimum contacts remain a
constitutional predicate for the exercise of a State's in
personam jurisdiction over an unconsenting defendant,
constitutional questions would arise if Rule 37 were
read to permit a plaintiff in a diversity action to subject a
defendant to a "fishing expedition" in a foreign
jurisdiction. A plaintiff is not entitled to discovery to
establish essentially speculative allegations necessary to
personal jurisdiction. Nor would the use of Rule 37
sanctions to enforce discovery orders constitute a mere
abuse of discretion in such a case.7 For me at least, such
a use of discovery would raise serious questions as to the
constitutional as well as the statutory authority of a
federal court — in a diversity case — to exercise personal
jurisdiction [456 U.S. 716] absent some showing of
minimum contacts between the unconsenting defendant
and the forum State.
II
In this case the facts alone — unaided by broad
jurisdictional theories — more than amply demonstrate
that the District Court possessed personal jurisdiction to
impose sanctions under Rule 37 and otherwise to
adjudicate this case. I would decide the case on this
narrow basis.
As recognized both by the District Court and the Court
of Appeals, the respondent adduced substantial support
for its jurisdictional assertions. By affidavit and other
evidence, it made a prima facie showing of "minimum
contacts." See 651 F. 2d, at 881-882, 886, and n. 9. In the
view of the District Court, the evidence adduced actually
was sufficient to sustain a finding of personal
jurisdiction independently of the Rule 37 sanction. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 51a, 53a.8
Where the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of
minimum contacts, I have little difficulty in holding that
its showing was sufficient to warrant the District
Court's entry of discovery orders. And where a
defendant then fails to comply with those orders, I agree
that the prima facie showing may be held adequate to
sustain the court's finding that minimum contacts exist,
either under Rule 37 or under a theory of "presumption"
or "waiver."
Finding that the decision of the Court of Appeals should
be affirmed on this ground, I concur in the judgment of
the Court.
