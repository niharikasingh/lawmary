This appeal presents the question whether the district
court properly dismissed plaintiff's case for lack of
jurisdiction because of an insufficient amount in
controversy under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). The trial court
felt compelled to dismiss all of plaintiffs claims when
one count was eliminated and the remaining liquidated
damages totalled less than fifty thousand dollars. Because
we think the district court had discretion to retain the
remaining counts, we reverse and remand the case for
an appropriate exercise of that discretion.
I.
In 1993, Kathleen Shanaghan brought this diversity
action in Virginia against John Cahill and his company
Cahill & Associates, Inc., seeking to recover on three
separate debts. Her complaint alleged that in 1987 and
1988 she made three loans to Cahill and his company, in
the amounts of $40,000, $23,696, and $14,700. She
further alleged that the defendants had refused payment
despite repeated demands, and were in default on all
three debts.
The defendants filed an answer, and discovery
proceeded through March of 1994. Plaintiff produced
two promissory notes memorializing the loans of
$23,696 and $14,700. She was unable, however, to
provide a writing for the alleged loan of $40,000, though
she has always maintained that such a writing exists.
The defendants filed for partial [58 F.3d 109] summary
judgment in March of 1994, arguing that the claim on
the $40,000 loan was barred by the Virginia Statute of
Frauds, Va.Code § 11-2(4), and the Statute of
Limitations, Va.Code § 8.01-246. The district court
agreed and granted summary judgment on the $40,000
claim. Then, noting that the amount in controversy had
fallen below fifty thousand dollars, the court dismissed
the remaining claims for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. Plaintiff has appealed, challenging only the
dismissal of her two smaller claims.

A.
Federal district courts possess jurisdiction over cases in
diversity when "the matter in controversy exceeds the
sum or value of $50,000." 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (1988). A
plaintiff may aggregate smaller claims in order to reach
this threshold, as was done in this case. Griffin v. Red
Run Lodge, Inc., 610 F.2d 1198, 1204 (4th Cir. 1979).
After Shanaghan's claim for $40,000 was dismissed,
however, the district court concluded it was bound by §
1332 to dismiss her remaining aggregated claims of
$38,669. The court apparently believed it had no
discretion in this matter, but rather was faced with a
mandatory obligation to dismiss the case in its entirety,
despite the possibility of a statute of limitations bar to
refiling in state court, and regardless of the potential
merit of the remaining claims.
This assumption was in error. The basis for district
court discretion in this context lies in the model of
supplemental jurisdiction set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
The doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction indicates that
federal courts generally have discretion to retain or
dismiss state law claims when the federal basis for an
action drops away. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1993). Federal
supplemental jurisdiction was created by the Judicial
Improvement Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-650, Title III,
§ 310(a), which codified the doctrine of pendent
jurisdiction developed by the Supreme Court in the case
of United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S.
715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), and its
progeny.1 Section 1367(a) provides that
in any civil action of which the district courts have original
jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction
over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same
case or controversy under Article III of the United States
Constitution.
28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). Supplemental jurisdiction thus
allows parties to append state law claims over which
federal courts would otherwise lack jurisdiction, so long
as they form part of the same case or controversy as the
federal claims. Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138.
Moreover, the statute is not limited to cases where the
original basis for federal jurisdiction was a federal
question. It clearly provides for the operation of
supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. First, §
1367(a) is broadly phrased to provide for supplemental
jurisdiction over claims appended to "any civil action"
over which the court has "original jurisdiction." 28
U.S.C. § 1367(a). Second, § 1367(b) imposes specific
limits on the use of supplemental jurisdiction in
diversity cases in order to prevent the addition of parties
that would destroy complete diversity as required by §
1332, but otherwise plainly contemplates the use of
supplemental jurisdiction in that context. 28 U.S.C. §
1367(b). See also 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367, David Seigel,
Practice Commentary 832 (1993) (noting that "[b]y no
means does [§ 1367(b)] exclude [supplemental
jurisdiction] from diversity cases in general."). The only
possible interpretation of this language is that state law
claims between diverse parties that do not, however,
satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements appended
to diversity actions are cognizable under supplemental
jurisdiction.
[58 F.3d 110] The statute then goes on to provide that
courts "may decline" to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction in certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. §
1367(c). In particular, a court has discretion to dismiss
or keep a case when it "has dismissed all claims over
which it has original jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. §
1367(c)(3). Recent case law has emphasized that trial
courts enjoy wide latitude in determining whether or
not to retain jurisdiction over state claims when all
federal claims have been extinguished. See, e.g., Noble v.
White, 996 F.2d 797, 799 (5th Cir.1993). Among the
factors that inform this discretionary determination are
convenience and fairness to the parties, the existence of
any underlying issues of federal policy, comity, and
considerations of judicial economy. Carnegie-Mellon
University v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S.Ct.
614, 619 n.7, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988); Growth Horizons,
Inc. v. Delaware County, 983 F.2d 1277, 1284 (3d
Cir.1993). The doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction
"thus is a doctrine of flexibility, designed to allow courts
to deal with cases involving pendent claims in the
manner that most sensibly accommodates a range of
concerns and values." Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350, 108 S.Ct.
at 619.
B.
There are several reasons why the supplemental
jurisdiction model of discretion should apply when the
amount in controversy falls below the fifty thousand
dollar threshold, just as it does when a federal question
or a diverse claim falls out of a case. First, the same basic
pattern of circumstances exists in both contexts: the
jurisdictional basis of the action fades away and the
court is left with what would otherwise be a state law
case. There is no way to distinguish a reduction of the
amount in controversy from the disappearance of a
federal claim as contemplated under § 1367(c)(3).
Indeed, the factors applicable in the typical pendent
jurisdiction case are equally applicable here — comity,
the existence of a state limitations bar, and
considerations of judicial economy. Whenever the basis
for federal jurisdiction evaporates, Congress has
provided for discretion. There are no situations wherein
a federal court must retain jurisdiction over a state law
claim, which would not by itself support jurisdiction. It
makes little sense, then, to think of jurisdictional
amounts as a separate category of cases when they so
clearly fit into the congressional scheme of supplemental
jurisdiction. It does make sense, however, to have one
rule of district court discretion, not separate rules for
separate jurisdictional bases when simple logic dictates
that they be treated the same.
This point is illustrated by the fact that the grant of
discretion to retain or dismiss residual state law claims
in § 1367(c)(3) would apply in cases closely analogous to
the one before us. For example, § 1367(c)(3) provides on
its own terms for supplemental jurisdiction over an
inadequate amount in controversy if the claim that is
dismissed is in excess of $50,000. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)
("courts may ... exercise supplemental jurisdiction ... if ...
the district court has dismissed all claims over which it
has original jurisdiction"). In such a case the remaining
smaller claims would have been "pendent" to the larger
dismissed claim, and thus the court could choose to
exercise jurisdiction over them. See Worthams v.
Atlanta Life Ins. Co., 533 F.2d 994, 997-98 (6th
Cir.1976) (finding jurisdiction still existed over claim of
$7,900 when other $100,000 claim was dismissed). Here,
the only difference is that no single claim by itself
carried plaintiff into federal court, and so she was forced
to aggregate her various smaller claims to reach the
jurisdictional threshold. Similarly, supplemental
(ancillary) jurisdiction provides discretionary review of
counterclaims of less than $50,000 even when the
primary federal claim is dismissed. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367,
David Seigel, Practice Commentary 830 (1993). Hence, a
reduction of the amount in controversy below the
$50,000 limit simply does not affect the existence of
discretion to either retain or dismiss the remaining
claims.
Second, when § 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) and § 1367
(supplemental jurisdiction) are read together, the
natural conclusion is that the discretionary model may
be applied in the context of jurisdictional amounts in
liquidated damages cases. Section 1332(a) provides
positive, mandatory jurisdiction in diversity cases when
the amount is over [58 F.3d 111] $50,000. 28 U.S.C. §
1332(a). Section 1367(a) is a parallel to § 1332(a),
providing a similar positive grant of supplementary
jurisdiction. Section 1367(c), by contrast, is permissive,
allowing a court to decline that mandatory jurisdiction
when read in conjunction with § 1367(a). Thus, if §
1332(a) is read with § 1367(a), it fits together with the
permissive language of § 1367(c), allowing courts to
"decline" jurisdiction when the amount falls below
$50,000.
Moreover, § 1367(b), which limits the use of
supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases, speaks only
to preventing attempts by plaintiffs to circumvent
complete diversity. It bars jurisdiction over certain
claims against or by parties added through Fed. R.Civ.P.
14, 19, 20, or 24. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(b). Nothing in §
1367(b) precludes the use of a supplemental jurisdiction
analysis in diversity cases when the issue is the amount
in controversy rather than complete diversity. If
Congress had wanted to limit the use of supplemental
jurisdiction to prevent discretionary decisions in this
context, § 1367(b) would have been the obvious place in
which to do it.
Case law on jurisdictional amounts that predates § 1367
is in some tension with the statute. The case of St. Paul
Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283,
58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938), required retention of
jurisdiction over cases falling below the jurisdictional
amount threshold so long as the amount alleged in the
complaint was made in good faith. St. Paul, 303 U.S. at
288, 58 S.Ct. at 590. See also Lynch v. Porter, 446 F.2d
225, 228 (8th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92
S.Ct. 711, 30 L.Ed.2d 739 (1972). St. Paul further held
that a claim of good faith is negated only if it was a legal
certainty that, at the time of the complaint, the plaintiff
could not recover the requisite amount. St. Paul, 303
U.S. at 289, 58 S.Ct. at 590. However, the St. Paul test
was developed long before the modern concepts of
supplemental jurisdiction expressed in Gibbs. Under the
Gibbs approach, federal courts have discretion to
dismiss or retain residual state law claims. Congress, by
adopting § 1367, expressed an emphatic preference for
the Gibbs approach. A straightforward application of
the St. Paul rule would nevertheless mandate retention
of cases falling below the jurisdictional amount despite,
for example, the existence of novel or complex issues of
state law. Divesting federal courts of discretion in such
circumstances simply cannot be squared with the
statutory language. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1). Thus, the
strict St. Paul rule is inconsistent with the statutory
framework of § 1367 and so must be modified to fit the
contemporary congressional view of federal jurisdiction.
Indeed, any strict rule that mandates either retention or
dismissal of residual claims in all cases operates in
derogation of important competing interests. On the
one hand, a standard tied exclusively to the St. Paul rule
of good faith pleading fails to respect the congressional
purpose in raising the jurisdictional amount to the fifty
thousand dollar threshold. Congress recently raised the
amount in an effort to prevent state law claims for
modest sums from landing in federal court. See 136
Cong. Rec. S16295 (Section-by-Section Analysis of
Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act)
(noting increase intended to reduce federal caseload).
See also Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 339-40, 89 S.Ct.
1053, 1058-59, 22 L.Ed.2d 319 (1969) (purpose of steady
increases in jurisdictional amount is to stem rising
caseload of federal courts). A strict rule, however, that
required retention of all claims that pass the lenient
threshold of "good faith" pleading violates this basic
congressional purpose. It would require, for example,
federal judges to resolve cases that Congress believed all
along should be pressed in state court, because they
involved both limited sums and purely state law claims.
Thus, a rigid rule of retention would sacrifice the very
purpose of a jurisdictional amount requirement, not to
mention Congress' recent action in raising that amount
five-fold. See U.S.C. § 1332(a).
On the other hand, a rigid rule requiring dismissal once
the jurisdictional amount falls below the statutory
standard would work a serious injustice. It might result
in valid claims going unheard or in significant wastes of
judicial resources. These were the same [58 F.3d 112]
concerns that motivated the creation of pendent
jurisdiction in the first place. See Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726,
86 S.Ct. at 1139. Moreover, a rule of automatic dismissal
would encourage defendants in attempts to bootstrap a
win on a single liquidated claim into an overall victory.
If district courts lacked discretion, they would be unable
to combat such manipulations, and as a result
meritorious claims might fall by the wayside. Thus, the
potential injustice to litigants of a Rule of Dismissal is as
undesirable as the flood of trivial claims that might
result from a Rule of Retention. Justice is better served
by a jurisdictional rule that includes some measure of
discretion for the district court.
C.
The application of § 1367's discretionary analysis in the
context of a jurisdictional amount case is quite
straightforward. First, the court should look to the face
of the complaint itself to determine whether it is a legal
certainty that plaintiff's claims do not reach the required
amount. See St. Paul, 303 U.S. at 288, 58 S.Ct. at 590.
Unless the claim for an amount over the jurisdictional
prerequisite is made in bad faith, or unless it is plain
from the complaint that an amount less than the
jurisdictional amount is all that is at issue, the district
court has jurisdiction over the case. This is akin to a
"well-pleaded complaint" rule. Of course, if plaintiff has
alleged only a small amount of damages or it is
otherwise obvious that the jurisdictional amount under
§ 1332(a) cannot be satisfied, the court must dismiss the
case outright for lack of jurisdiction. Wiggins v. North
American Equitable Life Assurance Co., 644 F.2d 1014,
1016-18 (4th Cir.1981). In this case, by contrast, it
appears from the face of the complaint that Shanaghan
had alleged claims totaling well over the $50,000 limit.
Second, if some event subsequent to the complaint
reduces the amount in controversy, such as the dismissal
of one count based on the defendant's answer, the court
must then decide in its discretion whether to retain
jurisdiction over the remainder of the case. Here, courts
should be guided by the same kind of factors that inform
decisions in the supplemental jurisdiction context when
the federal basis of a case disappears. In general, courts
should weigh convenience and fairness to both parties,
as well as the interests of judicial economy. See In Re
Conklin, 946 F.2d 306, 322 (4th Cir.1991) (citing Gibbs,
383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138). In particular, it is
important to consider whether the amount claimed in
the complaint was made in good faith, or whether
plaintiff was consciously relying on flimsy grounds to
get into federal court. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S.
397, 404-05, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1213-14, 25 L.Ed.2d 442
(1970) (distinguishing initial "insubstantiality" from
subsequent "mootness"). Another critical equitable
factor is the existence of any state limitations bars to
refiling in state court.2 See Ridenour v. Andrews Federal
Credit Union, 897 F.2d 715, 722 (4th Cir.1990). Where,
as here, a plaintiff might suffer serious prejudice from
the dismissal of her action, courts should be more
willing to retain the case despite the smaller amount in
controversy. Next, courts should account for the
amount of time and energy that has already been
expended, and decide whether it might be more efficient
to simply retain jurisdiction. See Washington v. Union
Carbide Corp., 870 F.2d 957, 962 (4th Cir.1989). Finally,
other considerations may arise on a case-by-case basis,
such as the existence of some significant issue of state
law best resolved in state court, that could inform the
trial court's determination whether to keep or dismiss
the case entirely. See McCullough v. Branch Banking &
Trust Co., Inc., 844 F.Supp. 258, 260-62 (E.D.N.C.1993)
(describing discretionary analysis under § 1367(c)(3)),
aff'd, 35 F.3d 127 (4th Cir. 1994).
In sum, we leave it to the sound judgment of the district
court to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction over
residual liquidated [58 F.3d 113] claims under $50,000, so
long as it was not a legal certainty from the outset that
the plaintiff had no business being in federal court.
III.
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district
court is reversed, and this matter is remanded with
instructions to determine whether the court, in its
discretion, should maintain jurisdiction over plaintiff's
liquidated damages claims of $23,969 and $14,700.
REVERSED AND REMANDED.
