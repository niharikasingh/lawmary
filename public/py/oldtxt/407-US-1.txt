We granted certiorari to review a judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
declining to enforce a forum-selection clause governing
disputes arising under an international towage contract
between petitioners and respondent. The circuits have
differed in their approach to such clauses.1 For the
reasons stated hereafter, we vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals.
In November 1967, respondent Zapata, a Houston-based
American corporation, contracted with petitioner
Unterweser, a German corporation, to tow Zapata's
ocean-going, self-elevating drilling rig Chaparral from
Louisiana to a point off Ravenna, Italy, in the Adriatic
Sea, where Zapata had agreed to drill certain wells.
Zapata had solicited bids for the towage, and several
companies including Unterweser had responded.
Unterweser was the low bidder and Zapata requested it
to submit a contract, which it did. The contract
submitted by Unterweser contained the following
provision, which is at issue in this case:
"Any dispute arising must be treated before the London Court of
Justice."
[407 U.S. 3] In addition the contract contained two
clauses purporting to exculpate Unterweser from
liability for damages to the towed barge.2
After reviewing the contract and making several
changes, but without any alteration in the forumselection
or exculpatory clauses, a Zapata vice president
executed the contract and forwarded it to Unterweser in
Germany, where Unterweser accepted the changes, and
the contract became effective.
On January 5, 1968, Unterweser's deep sea tug Bremen
departed Venice, Louisiana, with the Chaparral in tow
bound for Italy. On January 9, while the flotilla was in
international waters in the middle of the Gulf of
Mexico, a severe storm arose. The sharp roll of the
Chaparral in Gulf waters caused its elevator legs, which
had been raised for the voyage, to break off and fall into
the sea, seriously damaging the Chaparral. In this
emergency situation Zapata instructed the Bremen to
tow its damaged rig to Tampa, Florida, the nearest port
of refuge.
On January 12, Zapata, ignoring its contract promise to
litigate "any dispute arising" in the English courts,
commenced a suit in admiralty in the United States [407
U.S. 4] District Court at Tampa, seeking $3,500,000
damages against Unterweser in personam and the
Bremen in rem, alleging negligent towage and breach of
contract.3 Unterweser responded by invoking the forum
clause of the towage contract, and moved to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction or on forum non conveniens
grounds, or in the alternative to stay the action pending
submission of the dispute to the "London Court of
Justice." Shortly thereafter, in February, before the
District Court had ruled on its motion to stay or dismiss
the United States action, Unterweser commenced an
action against Zapata seeking damages for breach of the
towage contract in the High Court of Justice in London,
as the contract provided. Zapata appeared in that court
to contest jurisdiction, but its challenge was rejected, the
English courts holding that the contractual forum
provision conferred jurisdiction.4
[407 U.S. 5] In the meantime, Unterweser was faced
with a dilemma in the pending action in the United
States court at Tampa. The six-month period for filing
action to limit its liability to Zapata and other potential
claimants was about to expire,5 but the United States
District Court in Tampa had not yet ruled on
Unterweser's motion to dismiss or stay Zapata's action.
On July 2, 1968, confronted with difficult alternatives,
Unterweser filed an action to limit its liability in the
District Court in Tampa. That court entered the
customary injunction against proceedings outside the
limitation court, and Zapata refiled its initial claim in the
limitation action.6
[407 U.S. 6] It was only at this juncture, on July 29, after
the six-month period for filing the limitation action had
run, that the District Court denied Unterweser's January
motion to dismiss or stay Zapata's initial action. In
denying the motion, that court relied on the prior
decision of the Court of Appeals in Carbon Black
Export, Inc. v. The Monrosa, 254 F.2d 297 (CA5 1958),
cert. dismissed, 359 U.S. 180 (1959). In that case the
Court of Appeals had held a forum-selection clause
unenforceable, reiterating the traditional view of many
American courts that "agreements in advance of
controversy whose object is to oust the jurisdiction of
the courts are contrary to public policy and will not be
enforced." 254 F. 2d, at 300-301.7 Apparently
concluding that it was bound by the Carbon Black case,
the District Court gave the forum-selection clause little,
if any, weight. Instead, the court treated the motion to
dismiss under normal forum non conveniens doctrine
applicable in the absence of such a clause, citing Gulf Oil
Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501 (1947). Under that
doctrine "unless the balance is strongly in favor of the
defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely
be disturbed." Id., at 508. The District Court concluded:
"The balance of conveniences here is not strongly in
favor of [Unterweser] and [Zapata's] choice of forum
should not be disturbed."
Thereafter, on January 21, 1969, the District Court
denied another motion by Unterweser to stay the
limitation action pending determination of the
controversy in the High Court of Justice in London and
granted Zapata's motion to restrain Unterweser from
litigating [407 U.S. 7] further in the London court. The
District Judge ruled that, having taken jurisdiction in the
limitation proceeding, he had jurisdiction to determine
all matters relating to the controversy. He ruled that
Unterweser should be required to "do equity" by
refraining from also litigating the controversy in the
London court, not only for the reasons he had
previously stated for denying Unterweser's first motion
to stay Zapata's action, but also because Unterweser had
invoked the United States court's jurisdiction to obtain
the benefit of the Limitation Act.
On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals
affirmed, and on rehearing en banc the panel opinion
was adopted, with six of the 14 en banc judges
dissenting. As had the District Court, the majority rested
on the Carbon Black decision, concluding that " `at the
very least' " that case stood for the proposition that a
forum-selection clause " `will not be enforced unless the
selected state would provide a more convenient forum
than the state in which suit is brought.' " From that
premise the Court of Appeals proceeded to conclude
that, apart from the forum-selection clause, the District
Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to decline
jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens. It
noted that (1) the flotilla never "escaped the Fifth
Circuit's mare nostrum, and the casualty occurred in
close proximity to the district court"; (2) a considerable
number of potential witnesses, including Zapata
crewmen, resided in the Gulf Coast area; (3) preparation
for the voyage and inspection and repair work had been
performed in the Gulf area; (4) the testimony of the
Bremen crew was available by way of deposition; (5)
England had no interest in or contact with the
controversy other than the forum-selection clause. The
Court of Appeals majority further noted that Zapata was
a United States citizen and "[t]he discretion [407 U.S. 8]
of the district court to remand the case to a foreign
forum was consequently limited"â€”especially since it
appeared likely that the English courts would enforce
the exculpatory clauses.8 In the Court of Appeals' view,
enforcement of such clauses would be contrary to public
policy in American courts under Bisso v. Inland
Waterways Corp., 349 U.S. 85 (1955), and Dixilyn
Drilling Corp. v. Crescent Towing & Salvage Co., 372
U.S. 697 (1963). Therefore, "[t]he district court was
entitled to consider that remanding Zapata to a foreign
forum, with no practical contact with the controversy,
could raise a bar to recovery by a United States citizen
which its own convenient courts would not
countenance."9
We hold, with the six dissenting members of the Court
of Appeals, that far too little weight and effect were
given to the forum clause in resolving this controversy.
For at least two decades we have witnessed an expansion
of overseas commercial activities by business enterprises
based in the United States. The barrier of distance that
once tended to confine a business concern to a modest
territory no longer does so. Here we see an American
[407 U.S. 9] company with special expertise contracting
with a foreign company to tow a complex machine
thousands of miles across seas and oceans. The
expansion of American business and industry will hardly
be encouraged if, not-withstanding solemn contracts,
we insist on a parochial concept that all disputes must be
resolved under our laws and in our courts. Absent a
contract forum, the considerations relied on by the
Court of Appeals would be persuasive reasons for
holding an American forum convenient in the
traditional sense, but in an era of expanding world trade
and commerce, the absolute aspects of the doctrine of
the Carbon Black case have little place and would be a
heavy hand indeed on the future development of
international commercial dealings by Americans. We
cannot have trade and commerce in world markets and
international waters exclusively on our terms, governed
by our laws, and resolved in our courts.
Forum-selection clauses have historically not been
favored by American courts. Many courts, federal and
state, have declined to enforce such clauses on the
ground that they were "contrary to public policy," or
that their effect was to "oust the jurisdiction" of the
court.10 Although [407 U.S. 10] this view apparently still
has considerable acceptance, other courts are tending to
adopt a more hospitable attitude toward forum-selection
clauses. This view, advanced in the well-reasoned
dissenting opinion in the instant case, is that such
clauses are prima facie valid and should be enforced
unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be
"unreasonable" under the circumstances.11 We believe
this is the correct doctrine to be followed by federal
district courts sitting in admiralty. It is merely the other
side of the proposition recognized by this Court in
National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S.
311 (1964), holding that in federal courts a party may
validly consent to be sued in a jurisdiction [407 U.S. 11]
where he cannot be found for service of process through
contractual designation of an "agent" for receipt of
process in that jurisdiction. In so holding, the Court
stated:
"[I]t is settled . . . that parties to a contract may agree in advance to
submit to the jurisdiction of a given court, to permit notice to be
served by the opposing party, or even to waive notice altogether."
Id., at 315-316.
This approach is substantially that followed in other
common-law countries including England.12 It is the
view advanced by noted scholars and that adopted by
the Restatement of the Conflict of Laws.13 It accords
with ancient concepts of freedom of contract and
reflects an appreciation of the expanding horizons of
American contractors who seek business in all parts of
the world. Not surprisingly, foreign businessmen prefer,
as do we, to [407 U.S. 12] have disputes resolved in their
own courts, but if that choice is not available, then in a
neutral forum with expertise in the subject matter.
Plainly, the courts of England meet the standards of
neutrality and long experience in admiralty litigation.
The choice of that forum was made in an arm's-length
negotiation by experienced and sophisticated
businessmen, and absent some compelling and
countervailing reason it should be honored by the
parties and enforced by the courts.
The argument that such clauses are improper because
they tend to "oust" a court of jurisdiction is hardly more
than a vestigial legal fiction. It appears to rest at core on
historical judicial resistance to any attempt to reduce the
power and business of a particular court and has little
place in an era when all courts are overloaded and when
businesses once essentially local now operate in world
markets. It reflects something of a provincial attitude
regarding the fairness of other tribunals. No one
seriously contends in this case that the forum-selection
clause "ousted" the District Court of jurisdiction over
Zapata's action. The threshold question is whether that
court should have exercised its jurisdiction to do more
than give effect to the legitimate expectations of the
parties, manifested in their freely negotiated agreement,
by specifically enforcing the forum clause.
There are compelling reasons why a freely negotiated
private international agreement, unaffected by fraud,
undue influence, or overweening bargaining power,14
such [407 U.S. 13] as that involved here, should be given
full effect. In this case, for example, we are concerned
with a far from routine transaction between companies
of two different nations contemplating the tow of an
extremely costly piece of equipment from Louisiana
across the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean,
through the Mediterranean Sea to its final destination in
the Adriatic Sea. In the course of its voyage, it was to
traverse the waters of many jurisdictions. The Chaparral
could have been damaged at any point along the route,
and there were countless possible ports of refuge. That
the accident occurred in the Gulf of Mexico and the
barge was towed to Tampa in an emergency were mere
fortuities. It cannot be doubted for a moment that the
parties sought to provide for a neutral forum for the
resolution of any disputes arising during the tow.
Manifestly much uncertainty and possibly great
inconvenience to both parties could arise if a suit could
be maintained in any jurisdiction in which an accident
might occur or if jurisdiction were left to any place
where the Bremen or Unterweser might happen to be
found.15 The elimination of all such uncertainties by
agreeing in advance on a forum acceptable to both
parties is an indispensable element in international
trade, [407 U.S. 14] commerce, and contracting. There is
strong evidence that the forum clause was a vital part of
the agreement,16 and it would be unrealistic to think
that the parties did not conduct their negotiations,
including fixing the monetary terms, with the
consequences of the forum clause figuring prominently
in their calculations. Under these circumstances, as
Justice Karminski reasoned in sustaining jurisdiction
over Zapata in the High Court of Justice, "[t]he force of
an agreement for litigation in this country, freely
entered into between two competent parties, seems to
me to be very powerful."
[407 U.S. 15] Thus, in the light of present-day
commercial realities and expanding international trade
we conclude that the forum clause should control absent
a strong showing that it should be set aside. Although
their opinions are not altogether explicit, it seems
reasonably clear that the District Court and the Court of
Appeals placed the burden on Unterweser to show that
London would be a more convenient forum than
Tampa, although the contract expressly resolved that
issue. The correct approach would have been to enforce
the forum clause specifically unless Zapata could clearly
show that enforcement would be unreasonable and
unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as
fraud or overreaching. Accordingly, the case must be
remanded for reconsideration.
We note, however, that there is nothing in the record
presently before us that would support a refusal to
enforce the forum clause. The Court of Appeals
suggested that enforcement would be contrary to the
public policy of the forum under Bisso v. Inland
Waterways Corp., 349 U.S. 85 (1955), because of the
prospect that the English courts would enforce the
clauses of the towage contract purporting to exculpate
Unterweser from liability for damages to the Chaparral.
A contractual choice-of-forum clause should be held
unenforceable if enforcement would contravene a
strong public policy of the forum in which suit is
brought, whether declared by statute or by judicial
decision. See, e. g., Boyd v. Grand Trunk W. R. Co., 338
U.S. 263 (1949). It is clear, however, that whatever the
proper scope of the policy expressed in Bisso, 17 it does
not reach this case. Bisso rested on considerations with
respect to the towage business strictly in [407 U.S. 16]
American waters, and those considerations are not
controlling in an international commercial agreement.
Speaking for the dissenting judges in the Court of
Appeals, Judge Wisdom pointed out:
"[W]e should be careful not to over-emphasize the strength of the
[Bisso] policy. . . . [T]wo concerns underlie the rejection of
exculpatory agreements: that they may be produced by
overweening bargaining power; and that they do not sufficiently
discourage negligence. . . . Here the conduct in question is that of a
foreign party occurring in international waters outside our
jurisdiction. The evidence disputes any notion of overreaching in
the contractual agreement. And for all we know, the uncertainties
and dangers in the new field of transoceanic towage of oil rigs were
so great that the tower was unwilling to take financial responsibility
for the risks, and the parties thus allocated responsibility for the
voyage to the tow. It is equally possible that the contract price took
this factor into account. I conclude that we should not invalidate
the forum selection clause here unless we are firmly convinced that
we would thereby significantly encourage negligent conduct within
the boundaries of the United States." 428 F. 2d, at 907-908.
(Footnotes omitted.)
Courts have also suggested that a forum clause, even
though it is freely bargained for and contravenes no
important public policy of the forum, may nevertheless
be "unreasonable" and unenforceable if the chosen
forum is seriously inconvenient for the trial of the
action. Of course, where it can be said with reasonable
assurance that at the time they entered the contract, the
parties to a freely negotiated private international
commercial agreement contemplated the claimed
inconvenience, it is difficult to see why any such claim
of inconvenience should be heard to render the forum
clause unenforceable. [407 U.S. 17] We are not here
dealing with an agreement between two Americans to
resolve their essentially local disputes in a remote alien
forum. In such a case, the serious inconvenience of the
contractual forum to one or both of the parties might
carry greater weight in determining the reasonableness
of the forum clause. The remoteness of the forum might
suggest that the agreement was an adhesive one, or that
the parties did not have the particular controversy in
mind when they made their agreement; yet even there
the party claiming should bear a heavy burden of
proof.18 Similarly, selection of a remote forum to apply
differing foreign law to an essentially American
controversy might contravene an important public
policy of the forum. For example, so long as Bisso
governs American courts with respect to the towage
business in American waters, it would quite arguably be
improper to permit an American tower to avoid that
policy by providing a foreign forum for resolution of his
disputes with an American towee.
This case, however, involves a freely negotiated
international commercial transaction between a
German and an American corporation for towage of a
vessel from the Gulf of Mexico to the Adriatic Sea. As
noted, selection of a London forum was clearly a
reasonable effort to bring vital certainty to this
international transaction and to provide a neutral forum
experienced and capable in the resolution of admiralty
litigation. Whatever "inconvenience" Zapata would
suffer by being forced to litigate in the contractual
forum as it agreed to do was clearly [407 U.S. 18]
foreseeable at the time of contracting. In such
circumstances it should be incumbent on the party
seeking to escape his contract to show that trial in the
contractual forum will be so gravely difficult and
inconvenient that he will for all practical purposes be
deprived of his day in court. Absent that, there is no
basis for concluding that it would be unfair, unjust, or
unreasonable to hold that party to his bargain.
In the course of its ruling on Unterweser's second
motion to stay the proceedings in Tampa, the District
Court did make a conclusory finding that the balance of
convenience was "strongly" in favor of litigation in
Tampa. However, as previously noted, in making that
finding the court erroneously placed the burden of proof
on Unterweser to show that the balance of convenience
was strongly in its favor.19 Moreover, the finding falls
far short of a conclusion that Zapata would be effectively
deprived of its day in court should it be [407 U.S. 19]
forced to litigate in London. Indeed, it cannot even be
assumed that it would be placed to the expense of
transporting its witnesses to London. It is not unusual
for important issues in international admiralty cases to
be dealt with by deposition. Both the District Court and
the Court of Appeals majority appeared satisfied that
Unterweser could receive a fair hearing in Tampa by
using deposition testimony of its witnesses from distant
places, and there is no reason to conclude that Zapata
could not use deposition testimony to equal advantage if
forced to litigate in London as it bound itself to do.
Nevertheless, to allow Zapata opportunity to carry its
heavy burden of showing not only that the balance of
convenience is strongly in favor of trial in Tampa (that
is, that it will be far more inconvenient for Zapata to
litigate in London than it will be for Unterweser to
litigate in Tampa), but also that a London trial will be so
manifestly and gravely inconvenient to Zapata that it
will be effectively deprived of a meaningful day in court,
we remand for further proceedings.
Zapata's remaining contentions do not require extended
treatment. It is clear that Unterweser's action in filing its
limitation complaint in the District Court in Tampa
was, so far as Zapata was concerned, solely a defensive
measure made necessary as a response to Zapata's breach
of the forum clause of the contract. When the sixmonth
statutory period for filing an action to limit its
liability had almost run without the District Court's
having ruled on Unterweser's initial motion to dismiss
or stay Zapata's action pursuant to the forum clause,
Unterweser had no other prudent alternative but to
protect itself by filing for limitation of its liability.20 Its
action in so doing was a direct consequence [407 U.S.
20] of Zapata's failure to abide by the forum clause of the
towage contract. There is no basis on which to conclude
that this purely necessary defensive action by
Unterweser should preclude it from relying on the
forum clause it bargained for.
For the first time in this litigation, Zapata has suggested
to this Court that the forum clause should not be
construed to provide for an exclusive forum or to
include in rem actions. However, the language of the
clause is clearly mandatory and all-encompassing; the
language of the clause in the Carbon Black case was far
different.21
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
Vacated and remanded.
