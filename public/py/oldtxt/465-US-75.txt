This case raises issues concerning the claim preclusive
effect
1 
 of a state-court judgment in the context of a
subsequent suit, under 42 U. S. C. 
§§
 1983 and 1985
(1976 ed., Supp. V), in federal court.
I
Petitioner, Dr. Ethel D. Migra, was employed by the
Warren (Ohio) City School District Board of Education
from August 1976 to June 1979. She served as
supervisor of elementary education. Her employment
was on an annual basis under written contracts for
successive school years.
[465 U.S. 78]
 On April 17, 1979, at a regularly scheduled
meeting, the Board, with all five of its members present,
unanimously adopted a resolution renewing Dr. Migra's
employment as supervisor for the 1979-1980 school
year. Being advised of this, she accepted the renewed
appointment by letter dated April 18 delivered to a
member of the Board on April 23. Early the following
morning her letter was passed on to the Superintendent
of Schools and to the Board's President.
The Board, however, held a special meeting, called by its
President, on the morning of April 24. Although there
appear to have been some irregularities about the call,
see Brief for Respondents 19, n., four of the five
members of the Board were present. The President first
read Dr. Migra's acceptance letter. Then, after disposing
of other business, a motion was made and adopted, by a
vote of 3 to 1, not to renew petitioner's employment for
the 1979-1980 school year. Dr. Migra was given written
notice of this nonrenewal and never received a written
contract of employment for that year. The Board's
absent member, James Culver, learned of the special
meeting and of Dr. Migra's termination after he
returned from Florida on April 25 where he had
attended a National School Boards Convention.
Petitioner brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas
of Trumbull County, Ohio, against the Board and its
three members who had voted not to renew her
employment. The complaint, although in five counts,
presented what the parties now accept as essentially two
causes of action, namely, breach of contract by the
Board, and wrongful interference by the individual
members with petitioner's contract of employment. The
state court, after a bench trial, "reserved and continued"
the "issue of conspiracy" and did not reach the question
of the individual members' liability. App. 39. It ruled
that under Ohio law petitioner had accepted the
employment proffered for 1979-1980, that this created a
binding contract between her and the Board, and that
the Board's subsequent action purporting not to renew
the employment 
[465 U.S. 79]
 relationship had no legal
effect. Id., at 41-52. The court awarded Dr. Migra
reinstatement to her position and compensatory
damages. Id., at 52. Thereafter, petitioner moved the
state trial court to dismiss without prejudice "the issue
of the conspiracy and individual board member
liability." Id., at 53. That motion was granted. Id., at 54.
The Ohio Court of Appeals, Eleventh District, in an
unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Court
of Common Pleas. Review was denied by the Supreme
Court of Ohio.
2
In July 1980, Dr. Migra filed the present action in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio against the Board, its then individual members,
and the Superintendent of Schools. Id., at 3. Her
complaint alleged that she had become the director of a
commission appointed by the Board to fashion a
voluntary plan for the desegregation of the District's
elementary schools; that she had prepared a social
studies curriculum; that the individual defendants
objected to and opposed the curriculum and resisted the
desegregation plan; that hostility and ill will toward
petitioner developed; and that, as a consequence, the
individual defendants determined not to renew
petitioner's contract of employment. Id., at 5-6. Many of
the alleged facts had been proved in the earlier state-
court litigation. Dr. Migra claimed that the Board's
actions were intended to punish her for the exercise of
her First Amendment rights. She also claimed that the
actions deprived her of property without due process
and denied her equal protection. Her federal claim 
[465
U.S. 80]
 thus arose under the First, Fifth, and
Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U. S. C. 
§§
 1983 and
1985 (1976 ed., Supp. V). She requested injunctive relief
and compensatory and punitive damages. App. 11-12.
Answers were filed in due course and shortly thereafter
the defendants moved for summary judgment on the
basis of res judicata and the bar of the statute of
limitations. Id., at 13-24.
The District Court granted summary judgment for the
defendants and dismissed the complaint. App. to Pet. for
Cert. C-17 — C-31, D-32. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, by a short unreported
order, affirmed. Id., at A-15. See 703 F.2d 564 (1982).
3
Because of the importance of the issue, and because of
differences among the Courts of Appeals, see n. 6, infra,
we granted certiorari. 459 U.S. 1102 (1983).
II
The Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause
4 
 is
implemented by the federal full faith and credit statute,
28 U. S. C. 
§
 1738. That statute reads in pertinent part:
"Such Acts, records and judicial proceedings or copies thereof, so
authenticated, shall have the same full faith and credit in every
court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as
they have by law or usage in the courts of such State, Territory or
Possession from which they are taken."
[465 U.S. 81]
 It is now settled that a federal court must
give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect
as would be given that judgment under the law of the
State in which the judgment was rendered. In Allen v.
McCurry, 449 U.S. 90 (1980), this Court said:
"Indeed, though the federal courts may look to the common law or
to the policies supporting res judicata and collateral estoppel in
assessing the preclusive effect of decisions of other federal courts,
Congress has specifically required all federal courts to give
preclusive effect to state-court judgments whenever the courts of
the State from which the judgments emerged would do so. . . ." Id.,
at 96.
This principle was restated in Kremer v. Chemical
Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461 (1982):
"Section 1738 requires federal courts to give the same preclusive
effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given
in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged." Id.,
at 466.
See also Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. 306 (1983).
Accordingly, in the absence of federal law modifying the
operation of 
§
 1738, the preclusive effect in federal court
of petitioner's state-court judgment is determined by
Ohio law.
In Allen, the Court considered whether 42 U. S. C. 
§
1983 modified the operation of 
§
 1738 so that a state-
court judgment was to receive less than normal
preclusive effect in a suit brought in federal court under
§
 1983. In that case, the respondent had been convicted
in a state-court criminal proceeding. In that proceeding,
the respondent sought to suppress certain evidence
against him on the ground that it had been obtained in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court
denied the motion to suppress. The respondent then
brought a 
§
 1983 suit in federal court against the officers
who had seized the evidence. The District Court held
the suit barred by collateral estoppel (issue preclusion)
because 
[465 U.S. 82]
 the issue of a Fourth Amendment
violation had been resolved against the respondent by
the denial of his suppression motion in the criminal
trial. The Court of Appeals reversed. That court
concluded that, because a 
§
 1983 suit was the
respondent's only route to a federal forum for his
constitutional claim,
5 
 and because one of 
§
 1983's
underlying purposes was to provide a federal cause of
action in situations where state courts were not
adequately protecting individual rights, the respondent
should be allowed to proceed to trial in federal court
unencumbered by collateral estoppel. This Court,
however, reversed the Court of Appeals, explaining:
"[N]othing in the language of 
§
 1983 remotely expresses any
congressional intent to contravene the common-law rules of
preclusion or to repeal the express statutory requirements of the
predecessor of 28 U. S. C. 
§
 1738 . . . . Section 1983 creates a new
federal cause of action. It says nothing about the preclusive effect of
state-court judgments.
"Moreover, the legislative history of 
§
 1983 does not in any clear
way suggest that Congress intended to repeal or restrict the
traditional doctrines of preclusion. . . . [T]he legislative history as a
whole . . . lends only the most equivocal support to any argument
that, in cases where the state courts have recognized the
constitutional claims asserted and provided fair procedures for
determining them, Congress intended to override 
§
 1738 or the
common-law rules of collateral estoppel and res judicata. Since
repeals by implication are disfavored. . . much clearer support than
this would be required to hold that 
§
 1738 and the traditional rules
of preclusion are not applicable to 
§
 1983 suits." 449 U. S., at 97-99.
[465 U.S. 83]
 Allen therefore made clear that issues actually litigated
in a state-court proceeding are entitled to the same preclusive effect
in a subsequent federal 
§
 1983 suit as they enjoy in the courts of the
State where the judgment was rendered.
The Court in Allen left open the possibility, however,
that the preclusive effect of a state-court judgment
might be different as to a federal issue that a 
§
 1983
litigant could have raised but did not raise in the earlier
state-court proceeding.
6 
 449 U. S., at 97, n. 10. That is
the central issue to be resolved in the present case.
Petitioner did not litigate her 
§
 1983 claim in state
court, and she asserts that the state-court judgment
should not preclude her suit in federal court simply
because her federal claim could have been litigated in the
state-court proceeding. Thus, petitioner urges this
Court to interpret the interplay of 
§
 1738 and 
§
 1983 in
such a way as to accord state-court judgments preclusive
effect in 
§
 1983 suits only as to issues actually litigated in
state court.
It is difficult to see how the policy concerns underlying 
§
1983 would justify a distinction between the issue
preclusive and claim preclusive effects of state-court
judgments. The argument that state-court judgments
should have less preclusive effect in 
§
 1983 suits than in
other federal suits is based on Congress' expressed
concern over the adequacy of 
[465 U.S. 84]
 state courts
as protectors of federal rights. See, e. g., Mitchum v.
Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 241-242 (1972). Allen recognized
that the enactment of 
§
 1983 was motivated partially out
of such concern, 449 U. S., at 98-99, but Allen
nevertheless held that 
§
 1983 did not open the way to
relitigation of an issue that had been determined in a
state criminal proceeding. Any distrust of state courts
that would justify a limitation on the preclusive effect of
state judgments in 
§
 1983 suits would presumably apply
equally to issues that actually were decided in a state
court as well as to those that could have been. If 
§
 1983
created an exception to the general preclusive effect
accorded to state-court judgments, such an exception
would seem to require similar treatment of both issue
preclusion and claim preclusion. Having rejected in
Allen the view that state-court judgments have no issue
preclusive effect in 
§
 1983 suits, we must reject the view
that 
§
 1983 prevents the judgment in petitioner's state-
court proceeding from creating a claim preclusion bar in
this case.
Petitioner suggests that to give state-court judgments
full issue preclusive effect but not claim preclusive effect
would enable litigants to bring their state claims in state
court and their federal claims in federal court, thereby
taking advantage of the relative expertise of both
forums. Although such a division may seem attractive
from a plaintiff's perspective, it is not the system
established by 
§
 1738. That statute embodies the view
that it is more important to give full faith and credit to
state-court judgments than to ensure separate forums
for federal and state claims. This reflects a variety of
concerns, including notions of comity, the need to
prevent vexatious litigation, and a desire to conserve
judicial resources.
In the present litigation, petitioner does not claim that
the state court would not have adjudicated her federal
claims had she presented them in her original suit in
state court. Alternatively, petitioner could have obtained
a federal forum for 
[465 U.S. 85]
 her federal claim by
litigating it first in a federal court.
7 
 Section 1983,
however, does not override state preclusion law and
guarantee petitioner a right to proceed to judgment in
state court on her state claims and then turn to federal
court for adjudication of her federal claims. We hold,
therefore, that petitioner's state-court judgment in this
litigation has the same claim preclusive effect in federal
court that the judgment would have in the Ohio state
courts.
III
It appears to us that preclusion law in Ohio has
experienced a gradual evolution, and that Ohio courts
recently have applied preclusion concepts more broadly
than in the past. For example, in Vasu v. Kohlers, Inc.,
145 Ohio St. 321, 61 N.E.2d 707 (1945), a plaintiff who
suffered both personal injury and property damages in
an automobile accident was held entitled to maintain a
separate suit against the defendant for each type of
injury. The theory was that "[i]njuries to both person
and property suffered by the same person as a result of
the same wrongful act are infringements of different
rights and give rise to distinct causes of action . . . ." Id.,
at 
[465 U.S. 86]
 321, 61 N. E. 2d, at 709 (syllabus 
¶
 4).
8 
 In
Rush v. Maple Heights, 167 Ohio St. 221, 147 N.E.2d
599 (1958), however, the Supreme Court of Ohio
specifically overruled "[p]aragraph four of the syllabus
in the [Vasu] case." Id., at 221, 235, 147 N. E. 2d, at 599,
607. The new approach was declared to be more in
accord with "modern practice," id., at 235, 147 N. E. 2d,
at 607, and was adopted in the hope that it might reduce
"much of the vexatious litigation, with its attendant
confusion, which has resulted in recent years from the
filing of separate petitions by the same plaintiff, one for
personal injuries and one for property damage although
sustained simultaneously." Id., at 234-235, 147 N. E. 2d,
at 607.
This holding, of course, did not fully solve for the Ohio
law the question as to what constitutes a "cause of
action" for claim preclusion purposes. The definition of
"cause of action" or "claim" is critical in the present
context because it seems that a basic rule of Ohio law is
that a person is entitled to one lawsuit for each "cause of
action" he possesses. Norwood v. McDonald, 142 Ohio
St. 299, 52 N.E.2d 67 (1943); Whitehead v. General Tel.
Co., 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 254 N.E.2d 10 (1969).
In 1968, the Supreme Court of Ohio twice dealt with the
question of what constitutes a cause of action for
preclusion purposes. Henderson v. Ryan, 13 Ohio St.2d
31, 233 N.E.2d 506; Sharp v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 15
Ohio St.2d 134, 239 N.E.2d 49. In each of these cases,
although a second action against the defendant was
permitted, the court clearly was developing a broader
and more expansive attitude toward claim preclusion.
See Henderson, 13 Ohio St. 2d, at 35, 38, 233 N. E. 2d, at
509-511; Sharp, 15 Ohio St. 2d, at 140, 239 N. E. 2d, at
54. In addition, the Ohio Supreme 
[465 U.S. 87]
 Court in
1970 adopted Rule 13 of the Ohio Rules of Civil
Procedure establishing a compulsory counterclaim
provision like its federal counterpart in Rule 13 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Then, in 1982, the Supreme Court of Ohio adopted
what appears to be a broad doctrine of preclusion
indeed, although in a defensive, not offensive, context.
Johnson's Island, Inc. v. Board of Township Trustees, 69
Ohio St.2d 241, 431 N.E.2d 672. The first syllabus by the
court recites:
"When in a prior injunction action brought to enjoin the defendant
landowner's violation of a zoning law, the defendant asserts the
affirmative defense of non-conforming use, but does not assert the
unconstitutionality of the law, the landowner is, on the principle of
res judicata, barred from later bringing a declaratory judgment
action alleging such law to be unconstitutional." Ibid., 431 N. E. 2d,
at 673.
See also Stromberg v. Board of Ed. of Bratenahl, 64
Ohio St.2d 98, 413 N.E.2d 1184 (1980).
In reading the opinion of the District Court in the
present litigation, we are unable to determine whether
that court was applying what it thought was the Ohio
law of preclusion. The opinion cites a Sixth Circuit
opinion that purported to enunciate Ohio law, Coogan
v. Cincinnati Bar Assn., 431 F.2d 1209 (1970), and also
relied on precedents from other Federal Courts of
Appeals applying both federal and state law. Our
holding today makes clear that Ohio state preclusion law
is to be applied to this case. Prudence also dictates that it
is the District Court, in the first instance, not this Court,
that should interpret Ohio preclusion law and apply it.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
vacated, and the case is remanded to that court so that it
may instruct the District Court to conduct such further
proceedings as are required by, and are consistent with,
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
