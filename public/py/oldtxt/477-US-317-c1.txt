I agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong in holding
that the moving defendant must always support his
motion with evidence or affidavits showing the absence
of a genuine dispute about a material fact. I also agree
that the movant may rely on depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and the like, to demonstrate that the
plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case and hence
that there can be no factual dispute. But the movant
must discharge the burden the Rules place upon him: It
is not enough to move for summary judgment without
supporting the motion in any way or with a conclusory
assertion that the plaintiff has no evidence to prove his
case.
A plaintiff need not initiate any discovery or reveal his
witnesses or evidence unless required to do so under the
discovery Rules or by court order. Of course, he must
respond if required to do so; but he need not also depose
his witnesses or obtain their affidavits to defeat a
summary judgment motion asserting only that he has
failed to produce any support for his case. It is the
defendant's task to negate, if he can, the claimed basis
for the suit.
Petitioner Celotex does not dispute that if respondent
has named a witness to support her claim, summary
judgment should not be granted without Celotex
somehow showing that the named witness' possible
testimony raises no genuine issue of material fact. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 43, 45. It asserts, however, that respondent
has failed on request to produce any basis for her case.
Respondent, on the other hand, does not contend that
she was not obligated to reveal her witnesses and
evidence but insists that she has revealed enough to
defeat the motion for summary judgment. Because the
Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address this
aspect [477 U.S. 329] of the case, I agree that the case
should be remanded for further proceedings.
