I join the Court's opinion and would underscore two
points. First, I do not read today's decision as
articulating a mechanical, per se rule. Cf. post, at 1781
(BREYER, J., concurring). The inquiry described by the
Court, ante, at 1777-1779, is situation specific. Among
relevant considerations: Were the lives and well-being
of others (motorists, pedestrians, police officers) at risk?
Was there a safer way, given the time, place, and
circumstances, to stop the fleeing vehicle? "[A]dmirable"
as "[an] attempt to craft an easy-to-apply legal test in the
Fourth Amendment context [may be]," the Court
explains, "in the end we must still slosh our way through
the factbound morass of `reasonableness.'" Ante, at
1778.
Second, were this case suitable for resolution on
qualified immunity grounds, without reaching the
constitutional question, Justice BREYER's discussion
would be engaging. See post, at 1780-1781 (urging the
Court to overrule Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121
S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). In joining the
Court's opinion, [127 S.Ct. 1780] however, Justice
BREYER apparently shares the view that, in the appeal
before us, the constitutional question warrants an
answer. The video footage of the car chase, he agrees,
demonstrates that the officer's conduct did not
transgress Fourth Amendment limitations. See post, at
1780. Confronting Saucier, therefore, is properly
reserved for another day and case. See ante, at 1774, n.
4.
