For reasons stated by Chief Judge Markey, writing for a
unanimous en banc Federal Circuit in Aerojet-General
Corp. v. Machine Tool Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle Ltd.,
895 F.2d 736 (1990), I conclude that, when the claim
stated in a compulsory counterclaim "aris[es] under"
federal patent law and is adjudicated on the merits by a
federal district court, the Federal Circuit has exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over that adjudication and other
determinations made in the same case. See id., at 741-
744 (distinguishing Christianson v. Colt Industries
Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800 (1988), in which this
Court affirmed the jurisdictional decision of the Federal
Circuit; in discussing the "well-pleaded complaint rule,"
the Federal Circuit observed that a patent infringement
[535 U.S. 840] counterclaim, unlike a patent issue raised
only as a defense, has as its own, independent
jurisdictional base 28 U. S. C. ยง 1338, i. e., such a claim
discretely "arises under the patent laws").
The question now before this Court bears not at all on a
plaintiff's choice of trial forum. The sole question
presented here concerns Congress' allocation of
adjudicatory authority among the federal courts of
appeals. At that appellate level, Congress sought to
eliminate forum shopping and to advance uniformity in
the interpretation and application of federal patent law.
See generally Dreyfuss, The Federal Circuit: A Case
Study in Specialized Courts, 64 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1, 30-37
(1989).
The Court's opinion dwells on district court authority.
See ante, at 829-832. But, all agree, Congress left that
authority entirely untouched. I would attend, instead, to
the unique context at issue, and give effect to Congress'
endeavor to grant the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate
jurisdiction at least over district court adjudications of
patent claims. See Dreyfuss, supra, at 36.
In the instant case, however, no patent claim was
actually adjudicated. For that sole reason, I join the
Court's judgment.
