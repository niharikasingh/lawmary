Appellant, a third-party defendant in a product liability
case, appeals a district court judgment in favor of the
defendant. The jury found for the defendant on the
ground that the defective aspects of the product at issue,
a ladder, did not cause the plaintiff's injuries. The jury
also found, via special verdict, that appellant made the
ladder in question and that it was defective. Appellant
argues that the district court should, somehow, have set
aside the finding that the appellant made the ladder.
Appellant cannot appeal the district court's failure to set
aside this finding for the basic reason that appellant did
not lose the case below; it won. A party cannot appeal a
judgment entered in its favor, because it lacks a
"personal stake in the appeal" sufficient to support
appellate jurisdiction. Deposit Guaranty National Bank
v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 336, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 63
L.Ed.2d 427 (1980); see 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶
203.06, at 3-23 (2d ed. 1985).
Appellant argues that an exception should be made, lest
the jury's finding be used against it in some future
litigation. But, the short and conclusive answer to this
contention is that the challenged finding has no
collateral estoppel effect, for it was not essential to the
favorable judgment. See Raxton Corp. v. Anania
Associates, Inc., 668 F.2d 622, 624 (1st Cir.1982); 18 C.

Procedure § 4421, at 199-203 (1981); Scott, Collateral
Estoppel by Judgment, 56 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 12-15 (1942).

special circumstances not present here. See Deposit

100 S.Ct. at 1170-71 [806 F.2d 1128] (allowing plaintiffs
who received judgment in their favor to appeal denial of
class action certification — a separate judicial holding
that directly affected their "economic interest");

victorious defendants in patent infringement suit to
appeal to eliminate from the decree the finding that the
patent, though not infringed, was valid — a finding with
direct and significant impact on the appellant). Thus, we
follow the general rule, not the exceptions.
Appeal Dismissed.
