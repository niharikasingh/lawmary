Respondent Katherine Griffis brought suit against
appellant Marianne Luban in Jefferson County,
Alabama, alleging defamation and invasion of privacy
arising out of statements made by Luban on the
internet. Luban did not appear in the Alabama action,
and the Alabama district court entered a default
judgment for $25,000 in damages and issued an
injunction prohibiting Luban from making certain
statements in the future. Griffis filed the Alabama
judgment in Ramsey County District Court, and Luban
brought a motion to vacate, challenging the jurisdiction
of the Alabama court. The Ramsey County District 
[646
N.W.2d 530]
 Court upheld personal jurisdiction of the
Alabama court over Luban, and the court of appeals
affirmed. We reverse.
Respondent Katherine Griffis, an Alabama resident, has
taught noncredit courses in ancient Egyptian history and
culture at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
Griffis also works as a self-employed consultant.
Appellant Marianne Luban, a Minnesota resident,
maintains a nonprofessional interest in the history and
culture of ancient Egypt. Both Luban and Griffis have
participated in an internet newsgroup on archeology,
the sci.archaeology newsgroup, since at least 1996. A
newsgroup is a forum for internet users that addresses a
specific topic and allows participants to exchange
information and engage in discussions or debate by
"posting" messages on the website. The sci.archaeology
newsgroup is public and so messages posted there can be
accessed anywhere by any person with internet access.
During the latter part of 1996 a disagreement arose
between Luban and Griffis relating to the subject of
Egypt and Egyptology. In December 1996 Luban posted
a message challenging Griffis's credentials as an
Egyptologist, and accusing Griffis of obtaining her
degree from a "box of Cracker Jacks." Griffis states that
she responded by citing her credentials in an electronic
message sent directly to Luban. The disagreement
continued into 1997, with both Luban and Griffis
continuing to post messages relating to their
disagreement on the sci.archaeology newsgroup. In May
1997, Griffis's attorney sent a letter to Luban demanding
that Luban refrain from attacking Griffis's character and
professional reputation. The letter threatened legal
action if Luban did not retract the prior statements and
refrain from future attacks. Although Griffis asserts that
Luban continued posting defamatory messages after
receiving this letter, the record before us does not
include any statements made by Luban, whether on the
sci.archaeology newsgroup or elsewhere, after March,
1997.
In September 1997, Griffis brought a defamation action
against Luban in Alabama state court. Griffis's
complaint alleged that Luban posted statements on the
newsgroup asserting that Griffis obtained membership
in the International Association of Egyptologists and
inclusion on other lists of Egyptologists by
misrepresenting her qualifications, that Griffis was a
liar, was not affiliated with the University of Alabama,
did not have a juris doctor degree, and that Griffis's
consulting business was not legitimate. Because Luban
was advised by her attorney that the Alabama state court
did not have personal jurisdiction over her, she did not
answer the complaint or make any appearance in the
Alabama action. On December 17, 1997, the Alabama
court entered a default judgment against Luban. The
court assessed damages in the amount of $25,000 and
also issued an injunction specifically enjoining Luban
from publishing certain statements in the future.
1
On May 5, 1998, Griffis filed the Alabama judgment in
Ramsey County District Court in order to enforce its
terms against Luban. Luban moved to vacate the
judgment on the basis that the Alabama court lacked
personal jurisdiction over her. A referee initially granted
Luban's motion, 
[646 N.W.2d 531]
 but on
reconsideration concluded that the Alabama court had
personal jurisdiction over Luban and ordered entry of a
Minnesota court judgment against Luban. On appeal,
the court of appeals vacated the referee's order because it
had not been confirmed or countersigned by a district
court judge. In the interim, Luban petitioned for
bankruptcy, and on March 15, 2000, the bankruptcy
court discharged the $25,000 judgment from the
Alabama court.
In March 2000, Luban renewed her motion in district
court to vacate the Alabama judgment, and Griffis filed a
cross-motion to enforce the Alabama injunction. The
court found that the Alabama district court had personal
jurisdiction over Luban and therefore the judgment
must be given full faith and credit. Judgment was
entered on December 21, 2000. On Luban's appeal, the
court of appeals affirmed, ruling that the district court
did not err in its determination that the Alabama court
properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Luban.
Griffis v. Luban, 633 N.W.2d 548, 553
(Minn.App.2001). The court of appeals concluded that
Luban was subject to the Alabama court's jurisdiction
because she made potentially defamatory statements that
were being read in Alabama and had knowledge of the
effect of those statements in Alabama. Id. Luban sought
and was granted review in this court.
The question presented is whether the Ramsey County
District Court correctly determined that the Alabama
district court had personal jurisdiction over Luban so
that the Alabama judgment is entitled to full faith and
credit in the Minnesota courts. This court recognizes
the right of a defendant to contest an action brought on
the basis of a foreign court's judgment by demonstrating
that the foreign court rendered the judgment in the
absence of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
David M. Rice, Inc. v. Intrex, Inc., 257 N.W.2d 370, 372
(Minn. 1977). Such judgments are not entitled to full
faith and credit in Minnesota. Uniform Enforcement of
Foreign Judgments Acts, Minn.Stat. 
§
 548.27 (2000);
Hutson v. Christensen, 295 Minn. 112, 117, 203 N.W.2d
535, 538 (1972). Minnesota courts will uphold a foreign
court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a
nonresident defendant when two requirements are met:
(1) compliance with the foreign state's law providing
jurisdiction, and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction under
circumstances that do not offend the Due Process Clause
of the federal constitution. Intrex, 257 N.W.2d at 372.
Whether personal jurisdiction exists is a question of law
and therefore our review is de novo. See V.H. v. Estate
of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d 649, 653 (Minn. 1996); see
also Matson v. Matson, 310 N.W.2d 502, 506
(Minn.1981) (applying de novo review to issue of
whether foreign judgment entitled to full faith and
credit).
For the first requirement, Minnesota courts apply the
law of the foreign state, as construed by that state's
courts. See David M. Rice, Inc., 257 N.W.2d at 372.
Alabama law extends personal jurisdiction over
nonresident defendants to the full extent permitted by
due process. Ala. R. Civ. P. 4.2(a)(1)(B); DeSotacho, Inc.
v. Valnit Industries, Inc., 350 So.2d 447, 449-50
(Ala.1977). Because Alabama provides jurisdiction as
broad as due process will allow, the first requirement is
subsumed by the second, and we need only determine
whether Alabama's exercise of personal jurisdiction over
Luban was consistent with due process.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
limits the power of a state court to exercise personal
jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to
circumstances where the defendant has "minimum
contacts" with the state so that "maintenance of the suit
does not offend 
[646 N.W.2d 532]
 `traditional notions
of fair play and substantial justice.'" International Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90
L.Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S.
457, 463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940)). Where the
defendant had "continuous and systematic" contacts
with the forum state, the court can exercise "general"
jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant for all
purposes, even for a claim that is not related to the
defendant's contacts with the forum state. Helicopteros
Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414-
16, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984) (quoting
Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437,
445, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952)). Griffis does not
contend that the Alabama courts could exercise general
jurisdiction over Luban. Where the nonresident
defendant's contacts with the forum state are not
sufficient for general jurisdiction, the defendant may
nonetheless be subject to "specific" jurisdiction—that is,
jurisdiction over a claim that allegedly arose out of the
defendant's contacts with the forum. Valspar Corp. v.
Lukken Color Corp., 495 N.W.2d 408, 411
(Minn.1992). Griffis contends that Luban had sufficient
contacts with Alabama, out of which her claims arose, to
support the Alabama court's exercise of specific
jurisdiction.
In judging minimum contacts for purposes of assessing
the validity of specific jurisdiction, a court focuses on
the "relationship among the defendant, the forum, and
the litigation." Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,
S.A., 466 U.S. at 414-16, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (quoting Shaffer
v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d
683 (1977)); West American Ins. Co. v. Westin, Inc.,
337 N.W.2d 676, 679 (Minn.1983). For the minimum
contacts requirement to be satisfied, the defendant must
have "purposefully avail[ed]" herself of the privilege of
conducting activities within the jurisdiction. Imo Indus.,
Inc. v. Kiekert AG, 155 F.3d 254, 259 (3d Cir. 1998)
(quoting and modifying Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S.
235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)). The
defendant's conduct and connections with the forum
state must be such that the defendant "should reasonably
anticipate being haled into court there." World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100
S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). The Supreme Court
has explained that specific jurisdiction may be found
where the nonresident defendant has "`purposefully
directed' his activities at residents of the forum and the
litigation results from alleged injuries that `arise out of
or relate to' those activities." Burger King Corp. v.
Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85
L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (quoting Keeton v. Hustler
Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79
L.Ed.2d 790 (1984), and Helicopteros Nacionales de
Colombia, S.A., 466 U.S. at 414).
In asserting that the Alabama district court had personal
jurisdiction over Luban, Griffis relies in particular, as
did the courts below, on Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783,
104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984). In Calder the
Supreme Court approved a test that had been employed
by the California courts in that case for determining
personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants who
allegedly committed an intentional tort outside the
forum. Id. at 787 & n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 1482. Rather than
focusing only on the defendant's conduct within or
contacts with the forum, the so-called "effects test"
approved in Calder allowed long-arm jurisdiction to be
based on the effects within the forum of tortious
conduct outside the forum. Id.
Calder involved an allegedly libelous National Enquirer
article written and edited by the defendants in Florida,
but concerning the California activities of a California
[646 N.W.2d 533]
 resident. Id. at 784-85, 104 S.Ct. 1482.
Although the Enquirer was distributed nationally, it had
its largest circulation in California. Id. at 784-85, 104
S.Ct. 1482. Plaintiff was an entertainer whose
profession, the Court pointed out, was centered in
California. Id. at 788, 104 S.Ct. 1482. She brought suit in
California against the Florida-based publication, its
distributing company, and the reporter and editor of the
article. Id. at 785-86, 104 S.Ct. 1482. The reporter and
editor moved to quash service of process for lack of
personal jurisdiction. Id. at 785-85, 104 S.Ct. 1482.
Although the investigative contacts of one defendant
with California, including a visit and several phone calls,
were alleged as a basis for jurisdiction, the Court found
it unnecessary to consider those direct contacts with the
forum. Id. at 786-87 & n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 1482. Instead, the
Court held that California had personal jurisdiction over
the reporter and editor because their Florida conduct
was "expressly aimed" at California, knowing that the
harmful effects would be felt primarily there. Id. at 789,
104 S.Ct. 1482. The Court emphasized that the alleged
tort was not "mere untargeted negligence." Id. Under
these circumstances, the Court found that defendants
"must `reasonably anticipate being haled into court'" in
California for their out-of-state actions. Id. at 790, 104
S.Ct. 1482 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.,
444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559).
Courts have come to varying conclusions about how
broadly the "effects test" approved in Calder can be
applied to find jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals has construed Calder very broadly,
concluding that "the state in which the victim of a tort
suffers the injury may entertain a suit against the
accused tortfeasor." Janmark, Inc. v. Reidy, 132 F.3d
1200, 1202 (7th Cir.1997). However, the other federal
courts of appeals that have considered the issue have
rejected this expansive view that Calder supports
specific jurisdiction in a forum state merely because the
harmful effects of an intentional tort committed in
another jurisdiction are primarily felt in the forum. E.g.,
Imo Indus., 155 F.3d at 265. Thus, courts have
consistently refused to find jurisdiction based on Calder
merely because the plaintiff was located in the forum
state and therefore felt the effects of the alleged
intentional tortious conduct there. E.g., id.; ESAB
Group, Inc. v. Centricut, Inc., 126 F.3d 617, 625-26 (4th
Cir.1997); Far West Capital, Inc. v. Towne, 46 F.3d
1071, 1080 (10th Cir.1995); Southmark Corp. v. Life
Investors Inc., 851 F.2d 763, 773 (5th Cir.1988). Instead,
the courts have construed Calder as requiring more than
mere effects in the forum state. For example, the Ninth
Circuit reasoned that "`something more'" than mere
effects is needed and found that something more in the
"`express aiming'" language of Calder. Bancroft &
Masters v. Augusta Nat'l, Inc. 223 F.3d 1082, 1087 (9th
Cir.2000) (quoting Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen,
141 F.3d 1316, 1321 (9th Cir.1998); Calder, 465 U.S. at
789, 104 S.Ct. 1482). But the court took a broad view of
express aiming by concluding that the requirement is
satisfied simply by "wrongful conduct [outside the
forum] individually targeting a known forum resident."
Id.
The Eighth Circuit adopted a narrower interpretation of
Calder, stating that it was more than "mere effects" that
supported the Supreme Court's holding. Hicklin Eng'g,
Inc. v. Aidco, Inc., 959 F.2d 738, 739 (8th Cir.1992). The
court found that the Iowa court's jurisdiction did not
extend over a Michigan company that sent allegedly
defamatory letters to customers of the Iowa-based
plaintiff company. Id. The customers to whom the
letters were sent were all located outside of Iowa. Id.
The 
[646 N.W.2d 534]
 court stated that while the
defendant's statements to the non-Iowa customers were
intended to promote the defendant's product to the
detriment of the plaintiff's and therefore might have an
adverse effect on the Iowa plaintiff, this effect alone was
not sufficient to establish jurisdiction. Id.
Within the spectrum of differing circuit court
interpretations of Calder, we believe the most cogent
analysis of the Calder effects test is that of the Third
Circuit in Imo Industries. In Imo Industries, the circuit
court expressed concern over the possible breadth of
Calder, asking whether under Calder a court can
automatically infer that an out-of-state defendant can
anticipate being haled into the forum from the fact that
the defendant knew that plaintiff resided in the forum.
155 F.3d at 262-63. After examining how a number of
other courts construed Calder, the Third Circuit
concluded that the Calder effects test is not satisfied by
the "mere allegation that the plaintiff feels the effect of
the defendant's conduct in the forum because the
plaintiff is located there." 155 F.3d at 263. Instead, the
court stated that Calder's holding "cannot be severed
from its facts." 155 F.3d at 261. The court explained that
in Calder the Supreme Court relied on three principal
findings in reaching its conclusion that the California
court properly exercised jurisdiction over the
nonresident defendants, and the circuit court
incorporated those findings into a three-prong analysis
for application of the Calder effects test. 155 F.3d at 261.
The test requires the plaintiff to show that: (1) the
defendant committed an intentional tort; (2) the
plaintiff felt the brunt of the harm caused by that tort in
the forum such that the forum state was the focal point
of the plaintiff's injury; and (3) the defendant expressly
aimed the tortious conduct at the forum such that the
forum state was the focal point of the tortious activity.
Id. at 265-66. Significantly, the court emphasized that to
satisfy the third prong, the plaintiff must show that "the
defendant knew that the plaintiff would suffer the brunt
of the harm caused by the tortious conduct in the forum,
and point to specific activity indicating that the
defendant expressly aimed its tortious conduct at the
forum." Id. at 266 (emphasis added).
We, too, are cautious about applying Calder too
broadly. Although the Supreme Court has engaged in
little further discussion of Calder, in one post-Calder
decision the Court did make it clear that foreseeability of
effects in the forum is not itself enough to justify long-
arm jurisdiction. The Court explained:
[T]he constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant
purposefully established "minimum contacts" in the forum State.
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, [326 U.S.] at 316, 66 S.Ct.
154. Although it has been argued that foreseeability of causing
injury in another State should be sufficient to establish such
contacts there when policy considerations so require, the Court has
consistently held that this kind of foreseeability is not a "sufficient
benchmark" for exercising personal jurisdiction. World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S., at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559.
Instead, "the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis ... is
that the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum State
are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court
there." Id., at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559.
Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174
(footnote omitted). If foreseeability of injury in the
forum is not enough, it follows that something more
than defendant's knowledge that the plaintiff is a
resident of the forum and will feel the 
[646 N.W.2d 535]
effects of the tortious conduct there must be necessary
to satisfy the effects test. We conclude that something
more than mere effects in the forum state is required,
and agree with the Third Circuit that the Supreme
Court did not "carve out a special intentional torts
exception to the traditional specific jurisdiction analysis,
so that a plaintiff could always sue in his or her home
state." Imo Indus., 155 F.3d at 265. Broad applications of
the effects test, such as those of the Seventh and Ninth
Circuits, cast too wide a net and incorrectly disregard
the factual underpinnings of the Court's holding in
Calder. We adopt the three-prong analysis articulated
by the Third Circuit in Imo Industries, as it properly
synthesizes the bases of the Court's decision in Calder
without effecting an overly broad application.
The critical question in this case turns on the third
prong, whether the defendant expressly aimed the
allegedly tortious conduct at the forum such that the
forum was the focal point of the tortious activity.
2 
 As
noted above, to satisfy the third prong, the plaintiff must
show that "the defendant knew that the plaintiff would
suffer the brunt of the harm caused by the tortious
conduct in the forum, and point to specific activity
indicating that the defendant expressly aimed its tortious
conduct at the forum." Imo Indus., 155 F.3d at 266.
Griffis argues that Luban directed the defamation at the
Alabama forum because she targeted her messages at
Griffis, whom she knew to be an Alabama resident, and
because Luban knew that messages posted on the
sci.archaeology newsgroup could be read anywhere in
the world and in fact were read by Griffis in Alabama.
Griffis further contends that Luban's defamatory
statements had "deleterious effects" on Griffis's
consulting business and her professional reputation in
Alabama. The district court agreed with Griffis, stating
that Luban "never denied that she knew Plaintiff was
located in Alabama, and that her allegedly defamatory
messages would have an `effect' on Plaintiff's
professional career in Alabama."
While the record supports the conclusion that Luban's
statements were intentionally directed at Griffis, whom
she knew to be an Alabama resident, we conclude that
the evidence does not demonstrate that Luban's
statements were "expressly aimed" at the state of
Alabama.
3 
 The parties agree that Luban published the
allegedly defamatory statements on an internet
newsgroup accessible to the public, but nothing in the
record indicates that the statements were targeted at the
state of Alabama or at an Alabama audience beyond
Griffis herself. The newsgroup on which Luban posted
her statements was 
[646 N.W.2d 536]
 organized around
the subjects of archeology and Egyptology, not Alabama
or the University of Alabama academic community.
According to Griffis, Luban's messages were widely read
by her colleagues—the other amateur Egyptologists who
participated in the sci.archaeology newsgroup. But
Griffis has not presented evidence that any other person
in Alabama read the statements. Nor has she asserted
that Alabama has a unique relationship with the field of
Egyptology, like the close relationship between the
plaintiff's profession and the forum state that the
Supreme Court found relevant in Calder. Therefore,
even if we assume Luban's statements were widely read
by followers of the sci.archaeology newsgroup, the
readers most likely would be spread all around the
country—maybe even around the world—and not
necessarily in the Alabama forum. The fact that
messages posted to the newsgroup could have been read
in Alabama, just as they could have been read anywhere
in the world, cannot suffice to establish Alabama as the
focal point of the defendant's conduct.
To support her assertion that Luban's statements
affected her professional integrity in Alabama, Griffis
relies on the message posted by a dean at the University
of Alabama. But that message simply verified that Griffis
had taught noncredit classes related to ancient Egypt at
the University of Alabama's Department of Special
Studies. The statement did not indicate an awareness of
Luban's statements, nor did it indicate that Griffis's
integrity or reputation had been impugned at the
University. Significantly, the dean posted the message to
another newsgroup because she did not have access to
sci.archaeology newsgroup on which Luban made her
postings. Griffis later copied the Dean's message onto
the sci.archaeology newsgroup. Thus nothing in the
factual record before us indicates that Luban's messages
were read by any other person in Alabama, or by anyone
in the academic community at the University of
Alabama. Griffis also relies on a letter her attorney
wrote to Luban threatening litigation to establish that
Luban knew her postings would harm Griffis's
consulting business in Alabama. But the letter states
only that Luban's statements were "threatening" Griffis's
business and did not specify any details about the
business. Nor does anything in the record establish that
Griffis's consulting business was focused in Alabama,
beyond the fact that Griffis herself was located there.
4
Unlike the facts in Calder, where the defamatory article
was focused on California activities of a California
plaintiff whose professional industry was centralized in
California and was carried by a national newspaper with
its highest circulation in California, Luban did not
"expressly aim" her statements at the state of Alabama
such that Alabama was the focal point of the tortious
activity.
In sum, we conclude that the record does not
demonstrate that Luban expressly aimed her allegedly
tortious conduct at the Alabama forum so as to satisfy
the third prong of the Imo Industries analysis. The mere
fact that Luban knew that Griffis resided and worked in
Alabama is not sufficient to extend personal jurisdiction
over Luban in Alabama, because that knowledge does
not demonstrate targeting of Alabama as the focal point
of the allegedly defamatory statements. As a result, even
if Luban knew or should have known that defamatory
statements about Griffis 
[646 N.W.2d 537]
 would affect
her in her home state of Alabama, that alone is not
enough to demonstrate that Alabama was the focal point
of Luban's tortious conduct. Failing this, Griffis cannot
rely on Calder to confer personal jurisdiction based on
Luban's allegedly intentional tortious conduct. Because
Griffis does not claim any other basis on which the
Alabama court could properly extend personal
jurisdiction over Luban, the judgment of the Alabama
court is not entitled to full faith and credit in Minnesota.
The decisions of the courts below enforcing the
Alabama judgment are therefore reversed, and the
Alabama judgment filed in Ramsey County District
Court on May 5, 1998, under the Uniform Enforcement
of Foreign Judgments Acts, Minn.Stat. 
§
 548.27, and the
Ramsey County District Court judgment entered on
December 21, 2000, based on the Alabama judgment,
are vacated.
Reversed and judgments vacated.
