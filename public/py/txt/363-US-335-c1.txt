Two Courts of Appeals disagreed about the meaning of
a federal law, as conscientious federal courts sometimes
do. From the point of view of efficient judicial
administration the resulting history of this litigation is
no subject for applause. But, as the Court points out, no
claim was made here that the decision of the Fifth
Circuit precluded Judge Hoffman or the Seventh Circuit
from remanding the case, and on the merits of that
question I agree with the Court that principles of res
judicata were inapplicable. In any event, the conflict
between the Circuits is now resolved, and what
happened here will not happen again.
