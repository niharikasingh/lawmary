I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of JUSTICE SCALIA's
opinion and concur in the judgment of affirmance. The
rule allowing jurisdiction to be obtained over a
nonresident by personal service in the forum State,
without more, has been and is so widely accepted
throughout this country that I could not possibly strike
it down, either on its face or as applied in this case, on
the ground that it denies due process of law guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the Court has
the authority under the Amendment to examine even
traditionally accepted procedures and declare them
invalid, e. g., Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977),
there has been no showing here or elsewhere that as a
general proposition the rule is so arbitrary and lacking
in common sense in so many instances that it should be
held violative of due process in every case. Furthermore,
until such a showing is made, which would be difficult
indeed, claims in individual cases that the rule would
operate unfairly as applied to the particular nonresident
involved need not be entertained. At least this would be
the case where presence in the forum State is
intentional, which would almost always be the fact.
Otherwise, there would be endless, fact-specific
litigation in the trial and appellate courts, including this
one. Here, personal service in California, without more,
is enough, and I agree that the judgment should be
affirmed.
