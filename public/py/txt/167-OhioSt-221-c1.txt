"The rule at common law and in a majority of the states
of the union is that damages resulting from a single
wrongful act, even though they include both property
and personal injury damages, are, when suffered by the
same person, the subject of only one action against the
wrongdoer."
However, he referred to the fact that there were a
number of state jurisdictions which followed the English
rule, laid down in Brunsden v. Humphrey, 14 Q. B., 141,
and known as the two-causes-of-action rule, and then
proceeded to announce that rule as the Ohio rule, and it
was written into the fourth paragraph of the syllabus of
the Vasu case. If it had [167 Ohio St. 236] been necessary
to decide the question whether a single tort gives rise to
two causes of action as to the one injured by such tort, I
would be reluctant to disturb that holding. However,
neither the discussion in the Vasu case as to whether a
single or double cause of action arises from one tort nor
the language of the fourth paragraph of the syllabus was
necessary to decide the issue presented in the case, and
obviously both such language and such paragraph are
obiter dicta and, therefore, are not as persuasive an
authority as if they had been appropriate to the question
presented.
As to the case of Brunsden v. Humphrey, supra, which is
the basis for the minority rule in this country, it seems
to me that the dissenting opinion of Lord Coleridge, as
quoted in the majority opinion in the present case, is not
only highly persuasive but logically unanswerable, and
that this court is justified in departing from the obiter
dicta of the Vasu case.
