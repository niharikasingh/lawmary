This case presents the issue whether in a diversity action
the federal court should follow state law or,
alternatively, Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure in determining when an action is commenced
for the purpose of tolling the state statute of limitations.
I
According to the allegations of the complaint,
petitioner, a carpenter, was injured on August 22, 1975,
in Oklahoma City, Okla., while pounding a Sheffield nail
into a cement wall. Respondent was the manufacturer of
the nail. Petitioner claimed that the nail contained a
defect which caused its head to shatter and strike him in
the right eye, resulting in permanent injuries. The defect
was allegedly caused by respondent's negligence in
manufacture and design.
Petitioner is a resident of Oklahoma, and respondent is a
foreign corporation having its principal place of
business in a [446 U.S. 742] State other than Oklahoma.
Since there was diversity of citizenship, petitioner
brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma. The complaint was filed
on August 19, 1977. Although summons was issued that
same day,1 service of process was not made on
respondent's authorized service agent until December 1,
1977.2 On January 5, 1978, respondent filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was
barred by the applicable Oklahoma statute of limitations.
Although the complaint had been filed within the 2-year
statute of limitations, Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, § 95 (1971),3
state law does not deem the action "commenced" for
purposes of the statute of limitations until service of the
summons on the defendant, [446 U.S. 743] Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 12, § 97 (1971).4 If the complaint is filed within the
limitations period, however, the action is deemed to
have commenced from that date of filing if the plaintiff
serves the defendant within 60 days, even though that
service may occur outside the limitations period. Ibid. In
this case, service was not effectuated until long after this
60-day period had expired. Petitioner in his reply brief
to the motion to dismiss admitted that his case would be
foreclosed in state court, but he argued that Rule 3 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the
manner in which an action is commenced in federal
court for all purposes, including the tolling of the state
statute of limitations.5
The District Court dismissed the complaint as barred by
the Oklahoma statute of limitations. 452 F.Supp. 243
(1978). The court concluded that Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, §
97 (1971) was "an integral part of the Oklahoma statute
of limitations," 452 F. Supp., at 245, and therefore under
Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337
U.S. 530 (1949), state law applied. The court rejected the
argument that Ragan had been implicitly overruled in
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460 (1965).
[446 U.S. 744] The United States Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 592 F.2d 1133 (1979). That
court concluded that Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, § 97 (1971),
was in "direct conflict" with Rule 3. 592 F. 2d, at 1135.
However, the Oklahoma statute was "indistinguishable"
from the statute involved in Ragan, and the court felt
itself "constrained" to follow Ragan. 592 F. 2d, at 1136.
We granted certiorari, 444 U.S. 823 (1979), because of a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals.6 We now affirm.
II
The question whether state or federal law should apply
on various issues arising in an action based on state law
which has been brought in federal court under diversity
of citizenship jurisdiction has troubled this Court for
many years. In the landmark decision of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), we overturned the rule
expressed in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), that
federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction need not,
in matters of "general jurisprudence," apply the
nonstatutory law of the State. The Court noted [446
U.S. 745] that "[d]iversity of citizenship jurisdiction was
conferred in order to prevent apprehended
discrimination in state courts against those not citizens
of the State," Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, at 74. The
doctrine of Swift v. Tyson had led to the undesirable
results of discrimination in favor of non-citizens,
prevention of uniformity in the administration of state
law, and forum shopping. 304 U. S., at 74-75. In
response, we established the rule that "[e]xcept in
matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts
of Congress, the law to be applied in any [diversity] case
is the law of the State," id., at 78.
In Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99 (1945), we
addressed ourselves to "the narrow question whether,
when no recovery could be had in a State court because
the action is barred by the statute of limitations, a
federal court in equity can take cognizance of the suit
because there is diversity of citizenship between the
parties," id., at 107. The Court held that the Erie
doctrine applied to suits in equity as well as to actions at
law. In construing Erie we noted that "[i]n essence, the
intent of that decision was to insure that, in all cases
where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely
because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the
outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be
substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the
outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State
court." 326 U. S., at 109. We concluded that the state
statute of limitations should be applied. "Plainly enough,
a statute that would completely bar recovery in a suit if
brought in a State court bears on a State-created right
vitally and not merely formally or negligibly. As to
consequences that so intimately affect recovery or nonrecovery
a federal court in a diversity case should follow
State law." Id., at 110.
The decision in York led logically to our holding in
Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., supra.
In Ragan, the plaintiff had filed his complaint in federal
court on September 4, 1945, pursuant to Rule 3 of the
Federal Rules of [446 U.S. 746] Civil Procedure. The
accident from which the claim arose had occurred on
October 1, 1943. Service was made on the defendant on
December 28, 1945. The applicable statute of limitations
supplied by Kansas law was two years. Kansas had an
additional statute which provided: "An action shall be
deemed commenced within the meaning of [the statute
of limitations], as to each defendant, at the date of the
summons which is served on him. . . . An attempt to
commence an action shall be deemed equivalent to the
commencement thereof within the meaning of this
article when the party faithfully, properly and diligently
endeavors to procure a service; but such attempt must
be followed by the first publication or service of the
summons within sixty days." Kan. Gen. Stat. § 60-308
(1935). The defendant moved for summary judgment on
the ground that the Kansas statute of limitations barred
the action since service had not been made within either
the 2-year period or the 60-day period. It was conceded
that had the case been brought in Kansas state court it
would have been barred. Nonetheless, the District Court
held that the statute had been tolled by the filing of the
complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed because "the
requirement of service of summons within the statutory
period was an integral part of that state's statute of
limitations." Ragan, 337 U. S., at 532.
We affirmed, relying on Erie and York. "We cannot
give [the cause of action] longer life in the federal court
than it would have had in the state court without adding
something to the cause of action. We may not do that
consistently with Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins." 337 U. S., at
533-534. We rejected the argument that Rule 3 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governed the manner
in which an action was commenced in federal court for
purposes of tolling the state statute of limitations.
Instead, we held that the service of summons statute
controlled because it was an integral part of the state
statute of limitations, and under York that statute of
limitations was part of the state-law cause of action.
[446 U.S. 747] Ragan was not our last pronouncement
in this difficult area, however. In 1965 we decided
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, holding that in a civil
action where federal jurisdiction was based upon
diversity of citizenship, Rule 4 (d) (1) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, rather than state law,
governed the manner in which process was served.
Massachusetts law required in-hand service on an
executor or administrator of an estate, whereas Rule 4
permits service by leaving copies of the summons and
complaint at the defendant's home with some person "of
suitable age and discretion." The Court noted that in the
absence of a conflicting state procedure, the Federal
Rule would plainly control, 380 U. S., at 465. We stated
that the "outcome-determination" test of Erie and York
had to be read with reference to the "twin aims" of Erie:
"discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of
inequitable administration of the laws." 380 U. S., at
468. We determined that the choice between the state
in-hand service rule and the Federal Rule "would be of
scant, if any, relevance to the choice of a forum," for the
plaintiff "was not presented with a situation where
application of the state rule would wholly bar recovery;
rather, adherence to the state rule would have resulted
only in altering the way in which process was served."
Id., at 469 (footnote omitted). This factor served to
distinguish that case from York and Ragan. See 380 U.
S., at 469, n. 10.
The Court in Hanna, however, pointed out "a more
fundamental flaw" in the defendant's argument in that
case. Id., at 469. The Court concluded that the Erie
doctrine was simply not the appropriate test of the
validity and applicability of one of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure:
"The Erie rule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule. It is
true that there have been cases where this Court had held applicable
a state rule in the face of an argument that the situation was
governed by one of the [446 U.S. 748] Federal Rules. But the
holding of each such case was not that Erie commanded
displacement of a Federal Rule by an inconsistent state rule, but
rather that the scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the
losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule
which covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the
enforcement of state law." 380 U. S., at 470.
The Court cited Ragan as one of the examples of this
proposition, 380 U. S., at 470, n. 12.7 The Court
explained that where the Federal Rule was clearly
applicable, as in Hanna, the test was whether the Rule
was within the scope of the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.
§ 2072, and if so, within a constitutional grant of power
such as the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I. 380 U.
S., at 470-472.
III
The present case is indistinguishable from Ragan. The
statutes in both cases require service of process to toll
the statute of limitations, and in fact the predecessor to
the Oklahoma statute in this case was derived from the
predecessor to the Kansas statute in Ragan. See Dr.
Koch Vegetable Tea Co. v. Davis, 48 Okla. 14, 22, 145 P.
337, 340 (1914). Here, as in Ragan, the complaint was
filed in federal court under diversity jurisdiction within
the 2-year statute of limitations, but service of process
did not occur until after the 2-year period and the 60-
day service period had run. In both cases the suit would
concededly have been barred in the applicable state
court, and in both instances the state service statute was
held to be an integral part of the statute of limitations by
the lower court more familiar than we with state law.
Accordingly, as the Court of Appeals held below, [446
U.S. 749] the instant action is barred by the statute of
limitations unless Ragan is no longer good law.
Petitioner argues that the analysis and holding of Ragan
did not survive our decision in Hanna.8 Petitioner's
position is that Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, § 97 (1971), is in
direct conflict with the Federal Rule. Under Hanna,
petitioner contends, the appropriate question is whether
Rule 3 is within the scope of the Rules Enabling Act and,
if so, within the constitutional power of Congress. In
petitioner's view, the Federal Rule is to be applied unless
it violates one of those two restrictions. This argument
ignores both the force of stare decisis and the specific
limitations that we carefully placed on the Hanna
analysis.
We note at the outset that the doctrine of stare decisis
weighs heavily against petitioner in this case. Petitioner
seeks to have us overrule our decision in Ragan. Stare
decisis does not mandate that earlier decisions be
enshrined forever, of course, but it does counsel that we
use caution in rejecting established law. In this case, the
reasons petitioner asserts for overruling Ragan are the
same factors which we concluded in Hanna did not
undermine the validity of Ragan. A litigant who in effect
asks us to reconsider not one but two prior decisions
bears a heavy burden of supporting such a change in our
jurisprudence. Petitioner here has not met that burden.
This Court in Hanna distinguished Ragan rather than
overruled it, and for good reason. Application of the
Hanna analysis is premised on a "direct collision"
between the Federal Rule and the state law. 380 U. S., at
472. In Hanna itself the "clash" between Rule 4 (d) (1)
and the state in-hand service requirement was
"unavoidable." 380 U. S., at 470. The first question must
therefore be whether the scope of the Federal Rule in
fact is sufficiently broad to control the issue before [446
U.S. 750] the Court. It is only if that question is
answered affirmatively that the Hanna analysis applies.9
As has already been noted, we recognized in Hanna that
the present case is an instance where "the scope of the
Federal Rule [is] not as broad as the losing party urge[s],
and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which
cover[s] the point in dispute, Erie command[s] the
enforcement of state law." Ibid. Rule 3 simply states that
"[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with
the court." There is no indication that the Rule was
intended to toll a state statute of limitations,10 much less
that it purported to displace state [446 U.S. 751] tolling
rules for purposes of state statutes of limitations. In our
view, in diversity actions11 Rule 3 governs the date from
which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules
begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of
limitations. Cf. 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 1057, pp. 190-191 (1969); id., §
1051, at 165-166.
In contrast to Rule 3, the Oklahoma statute is a
statement of a substantive decision by that State that
actual service on, and accordingly actual notice by, the
defendant is an integral part of the several policies
served by the statute of limitations. See C & C Tile Co.
v. Independent School District No. 7 of Tulsa County,
503 P.2d 554, 559 (Okla. 1972). The statute of
limitations establishes a deadline after which the
defendant may legitimately have peace of mind; it also
recognizes that after a certain period of time it is unfair
to require the defendant to attempt to piece together his
defense to an old claim. A requirement of actual service
promotes both of those functions of the statute. See
generally ibid.; Seitz v. Jones, 370 P.2d 300, 302 (Okla.
1961). See also Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87
Harv. L. Rev. 693, 730-731 (1974).12 It is these policy
aspects which make the service [446 U.S. 752]
requirement an "integral" part of the statute of
limitations both in this case and in Ragan. As such, the
service rule must be considered part and parcel of the
statute of limitations.13 Rule 3 does not replace such
policy determinations found in state law. Rule 3 and
Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, § 97 (1971), can exist side by side,
therefore, each controlling its own intended sphere of
coverage without conflict.
Since there is no direct conflict between the Federal
Rule and the state law, the Hanna analysis does not
apply.14 Instead, the policies behind Erie and Ragan
control the issue whether, in the absence of a federal
rule directly on point, state service requirements which
are an integral part of the state statute of limitations
should control in an action based on state law which is
filed in federal court under diversity [446 U.S. 753]
jurisdiction. The reasons for the application of such a
state service requirement in a diversity action in the
absence of a conflicting federal rule are well explained in
Erie and Ragan, see supra, at 744-746, and need not be
repeated here. It is sufficient to note that although in
this case failure to apply the state service law might not
create any problem of forum shopping,15 the result
would be an "inequitable administration" of the law.
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S., at 468. There is simply no
reason why, in the absence of a controlling federal rule,
an action based on state law which concededly would be
barred in the state courts by the state statute of
limitations should proceed through litigation to
judgment in federal court solely because of the fortuity
that there is diversity of citizenship between the
litigants. The policies underlying diversity jurisdiction
do not support such a distinction between state and
federal plaintiffs, and Erie and its progeny do not permit
it.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
