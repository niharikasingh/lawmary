I respectfully dissent. In my view, the majority
overstates the significance of New Jersey's interests in
having its law apply in this case and understates the
interests of New York. While I agree with much of the
majority's general exposition of the rules governing
conflicts of law, nevertheless I believe that its
application of these rules to the facts of this case and the
resulting analysis are uneven. By casting the issue almost
exclusively in terms of New Jersey's law of charitable
immunity and the policy purposes represented thereby,
the majority preordains its decision that the application
of New Jersey law would best serve the interests deemed
relevant. A more balanced approach, which recognizes
that the conflict in this case involves not only New
Jersey's law of charitable immunity but also New York's
law of charitable nonimmunity, and which accords a
proper analysis and fairer significance to the policies
underlying the latter, would dictate a different result.
Because New Jersey's interests in having its law of
charitable immunity apply are rather attenuated in this
case and, by sharp contrast, New York's interests as the
"locus-forum" in applying its rule of charitable
nonimmunity are overriding — especially in light of the
heinous nature of the alleged tortious conduct involved
and the repugnancy of immunizing those responsible
from liability — it is my view that New York law should
govern this case. A brief highlighting of those factors
which I believe to be most pertinent illustrates what, in
my view, the majority has either understated or
overlooked.
[65 N.Y.2d 206] New Jersey's interests, denominated by
the majority as loss-distribution, are hardly pressing
under the circumstances. While it is true that laws
providing for charitable immunity typically are intended
to serve the purpose of protecting and promoting the
charities incorporated within a state's jurisdiction, that
function is virtually irrelevant in this case. Presently,
neither corporate defendant is a resident of New Jersey.
The Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis (the Franciscan
Brothers) has at all relevant times been a resident of the
State of Ohio, a jurisdiction which recognizes only a
limited charitable immunity that does not extend to
negligence in the selection and retention of personnel.
(Williams v First United Church, 40 Ohio App.2d 187,
318 N.E.2d 562, affd37 Ohio St.2d 150, 309 N.E.2d 924;
Cullen v Schmit, 139 Ohio St. 194, 39 N.E.2d 146.) The
Boy Scouts of America, although originally incorporated
in New Jersey at the time of its alleged tortious conduct,
has since relocated in Texas, a State which has wholly
rejected charitable immunity. (Howle v Camp Amon
Carter, 470 S.W.2d 629 [Tex].) While ordinarily a
change in residence subsequent to the events upon
which a lawsuit is predicated ought not to affect the
rights and liabilities of the parties in order to avoid
forum-shopping, there is no such reason to deny giving
effect to the change in residence here. Rather, a
defendant's post-tort change in residence — as opposed
to that of a plaintiff — is often critical insofar as it affects
state interest analysis. (See, Weintraub, Commentary on
the Conflict of Laws § 6.28, at 331, 334 [2d ed]; Sedler,
The Governmental Interest Approach to Choice of Law:
An Analysis and a Reformulation, 25 UCLA L Rev 181,
241-242; Note, Post Transaction or Occurrence Events
in Conflicts of Laws, 69 Colum L Rev 843, 865.) Indeed,
as this court stated in Miller v Miller (22 N.Y.2d 12, 21-
22): "To the extent that the [foreign State's] limitation
evinced a desire to protect its residents in wrongful
death actions, that purpose cannot be defeated here
since no judgment in this action will be entered against a
* * * resident [of that State. It] would have no concern
with the nature of the recovery awarded against
defendants who are no longer residents of that State and
who are, therefore, no longer proper objects of its
legislative concern. It is true that, at the time of the
accident, the defendants were residents of [that State]
but they would have no vested right to the application of
the law of their former residence unless it could be
demonstrated that they had governed their conduct in
reliance upon it (Griffith v. United Air Lines, supra) — a
reliance which is neither present nor claimed in the case
at bar. Any claim that [the foreign State] has a
paternalistic interest in protecting its residents [65
N.Y.2d 207] against liability for acts committed while
they were in [that State] should they move to another
jurisdiction, is highly speculative."
It simply cannot be disputed that New Jersey presently
has a much diminished interest, if any at all, in shielding
the Boy Scouts of America from liability — let alone the
Franciscan Brothers which has never been a New Jersey
resident. The majority does not question that
conclusion, but merely states that the change in
residence does not enhance New York's interest.
(Majority opn, at p 194.) While the latter may be true in
the abstract, the point, of course, is that New Jersey's
interest in the application of its charitable immunity law
has been substantially reduced.
Consequently, because the majority cannot in actuality
rely upon New Jersey's interest in protecting resident
charities — into which category neither corporate
defendant now falls — the decision today is, in effect,
predicated almost exclusively upon the plaintiffs' New
Jersey domicile. What emerges from the majority's
holding is an entirely untoward rule that nonresident
plaintiffs are somehow less entitled to the protections of
this State's law while they are within our borders.
Besides smacking of arbitrary and injudicious
discrimination against guests in this State and before our
courts (see, Ely, Choice of Law and the State's Interest in
Protecting Its Own, 23 Wm & Mary L Rev 173, 186-
187; cf.Tooker v Lopez, 24 N.Y.2d 569, 575; Smith v
Loughman, 245 N.Y. 486, 491-492, cert denied 275 U.S.
560), such a position, without more, has severely
limited, if any, validity in resolving conflicts questions.
(See, Neumeier v Kuehner, 31 N.Y.2d 121, 131 [Breitel,
J., concurring]; Rosenthal v Warren, 475 F.2d 438, 445
[2d Cir]; Juenger, Choice of Law in Interstate Torts, 118
U of Pa L Rev 202, 209-210; Weintraub, supra, § 6.23, n
13; Ausubel, Conflict of Laws Trends — Torts, 19 De
Paul L Rev 684, 692; cf.Labree v Major, 111 R.I. 657,
306 A.2d 808; Hurtado v Superior Ct., 11 Cal.3d 574,
522 P.2d 666.) This is especially so where, as here, the
defendants' contacts with the foreign State are
insignificant for the purposes of interest analysis while,
at the same time, the parties' contacts with New York
are so clear and direct, and the resulting interests of this
State so strong.
There can be no question that this State has a
paramount interest in preventing and protecting against
injurious misconduct within its borders. This interest is
particularly vital and compelling where, as here, the
tortious misconduct involves sexual abuse and
exploitation of children, regardless of the residency of
the victims and the tort-feasors. (See, New York v
Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-760, on remand57 N.Y.2d
256.) [65 N.Y.2d 208] Despite the majority's denial, New
York's law in question is intimately connected to this
overriding interest.
As the majority stresses, a charitable immunity law such
as New Jersey's typically serves a loss-distribution
purpose reflecting a legislative paternalism toward
resident charities. But that is obviously not true with
regard to a rule, such as New York's, which denies
charitable immunity. Consequently, it is mistaken to
adjudge the propriety of applying the latter law by
giving weight only to the interests served by the former.
(But see, e.g., majority opn, at p 200.) A closer attention
to the specific policy purposes of New York's charitable
nonimmunity rule is essential to a more appropriate
resolution of the conflict.
These purposes, to which the majority refuses to accord
any significance (see, e.g., majority opn, at pp 200, 201),
are preventive, protective and compensatory. Indeed, in
Bing v Thunig (2 N.Y.2d 656), where New York's prior
rule of charitable immunity was abolished, this court
held that "[i]t is not alone good morals but sound law
that individuals and organizations should be just before
they are generous, and there is no reason why that
should not apply to charitable [institutions] * * *
Insistence upon * * * damages for negligent injury
serves a two-fold purpose, for it both assures payment
of an obligation to the person injured and gives warning
that justice and the law demand exercise of care." (Id., at
p 666 [emphasis added].)
As previously discussed, there can be little doubt that
New York has an interest in insuring that justice be
done to nonresidents who have come to this State and
suffered serious injuries herein. There is no cogent
reason to deem that interest any weaker whether such
guests are here for the purpose of conducting business
or personal affairs, or, as in this case, have chosen to
spend their vacation in New York. (See additionally,
Korn, The Choice of Law Revolution: A Critique, 83
Colum L Rev 772, 789, n 40.) Likewise, it cannot be
denied that this State has a strong legitimate interest in
deterring serious tortious misconduct, including the
kind of reprehensible malfeasance that has victimized
the nonresident infant plaintiffs in this case. Indeed, this
deterrence function of tort law, whether it be in the
form of imposing liability or denying immunity, is a
substantial interest of the locus state which is almost
universally acknowledged by both commentators and
the courts to be a prominent factor deserving significant
consideration in the resolution of conflicts problems.
(See, Cavers, The Choice of Law Process, at 144;
Weintraub, supra, § 6.10, at 288; Horowitz, The Law of
Choice of [65 N.Y.2d 209] Law in California — A
Restatement, 21 UCLA L Rev 719, 757; Baade, CounterRevolution
or Alliance for Progress? Reflections on

Rev 141, 156; Restatement [Second] of Conflict of Laws

N.H. 125, 290 A.2d 624; Hunker v Royal Indem. Co., 57
Wis.2d 588, 204 N.W.2d 897.) While the majority
mentions New York's interest in deterrence, it dismisses
that interest in short fashion by referring to the "rule in
conflict" as being "loss-allocating rather than conductregulating."
(See, majority opn, at p 200.) Of course,
there is not one but two rules at issue, and the majority's
characterization is accurate only with regard to New
Jersey's law granting immunity, not with regard to New
York's rule denying the same. (Bing v Thunig, supra, at
p 666.)
Moreover, New York's strong interest in deterring
injurious misconduct, as well as in providing
compensatory justice and protection to persons
victimized by wrongdoing within this State, is reflected
in the traditional principle of lex loci which, despite the
majority's sub silentio disavowal, remains in this State
"the general rule in tort cases to be displaced only in
extraordinary circumstances". (Cousins v Instrument
Flyers, 44 N.Y.2d 698, 699; see also, Neumeier v
Kuehner, 31 N.Y.2d 121, 129, 131-132, supra; Tooker v
Lopez, 24 N.Y.2d 569, 585, supra.) Indeed, despite the
so-called "choice of law revolution" (see, Korn, supra),
lex loci is still acknowledged almost universally as a
central factor in determining the state, or states, in
which the significant interests lie. (See, Restatement
[Second] of Conflict of Laws § 145 [2] [a], [b]; § 146.)
This rule ought not to be applied mechanically or rigidly
to reach absurd results. But, neither ought it to be
disregarded indiscriminately, without giving due
consideration to the nature or extent of the relationship
which accrues between the tort in question and a
particular jurisdiction because that jurisdiction is the
locus state. (See, Reese, The Second Restatement of
Laws Revisited, 34 Mercer L Rev 501, 513-515.)
Here, there are no extraordinary circumstances
justifying displacement of the usual rule of lex loci and
the consequent disregard of New York's interest as the
jurisdiction in which the infant plaintiffs were
victimized. The majority merely discounts New York's
interests as the locus state by characterizing the parties'
contacts in New York as "only isolated and infrequent".
Reliance on such characterization, however, is both
factually [65 N.Y.2d 210] and legally misplaced. The
infant plaintiffs' visit to New York with defendants'
tort-feasor was entirely deliberate, planned and not
merely transitory. They visited in order to remain for a
period of time. Defendants are alleged to have permitted
their tort-feasor to take the children into New York,
failed to supervise him while the children were in his
care in New York, authorized or sponsored the scouting
activity at a campground in New York which they
approved, and failed to prevent the sexual abuse of the
children taking place in New York. The nexus of the
parties and the alleged torts with New York can hardly
be gainsaid.
This is clearly not a case in which the locus can be
discounted as purely fortuitous or adventitious.
(Cf.Long v Pan Am. World Airways, 16 N.Y.2d 337,
342, n 3; Babcock v Jackson, 12 N.Y.2d 473, 483; Kilberg
v Northeast Airlines, 9 N.Y.2d 34, 39; contrast with,
Dym v Gordon, 16 N.Y.2d 120, 125.) The infant
plaintiffs and the defendants' tort-feasor were not
merely in transitu in New York. Rather, they were here
for a stay, albeit a short one, and as such they
deliberately submitted themselves to the protections and
responsibilities of this State's laws which should now
govern the consequences of the tortious conduct
committed while within New York's borders.
Contrary to what the majority states, it is hardly clear
that the parties' only reasonable expectation was that
New Jersey's law would apply despite the contacts with
this State. Indeed, it would surely seem that the parties
who came to New York, and those who sponsored their
visit here, would have been quite surprised to learn that
their conduct while in New York, or that which had a
direct impact in New York, was not governed by the
laws of this State. In any event, this court has
unequivocably rejected the notion that the fictional
expectation of the parties should determine the choice of
law in tort cases. (Tooker v Lopez, supra, at p 577;
Miller v Miller, 22 N.Y.2d 12, 20, supra; see also, Cavers,
The Choice of Law Process, 119, 302, supra.)
Consequently, in my view, the majority does not
adequately explain why the law of New York, the locus
state, ought not to govern this case.
Additionally, apart from the foregoing, I believe that
this court ought not to apply New Jersey's law of
charitable immunity by reason of its incompatibility
with this State's settled public policy. Almost 30 years
ago, when this court abolished charitable immunity for
this State, we explained that the rule was inherently
incongruous, contrary to both good morals and sound
law, out of tune with modern day needs, unfair and [65
N.Y.2d 211] confused. (Bing v Thunig, 2 N.Y.2d 656, at
pp 663, 666-667, supra.) Surely, a rule deemed so archaic
and anachronistic by this court ought not now to be
given effect and, thereby, insulate defendants from
whatever responsibility they should bear for the heinous
acts of misconduct performed in this State.
Indeed, this court has not hesitated in the past to refuse
a request to apply a foreign law considered contrary to
established public policy. We have held unequivocally
that where a conflict exists, this State's public policy
prevails. (Erlich-Bober & Co. v University of Houston,
49 N.Y.2d 574, 580; see also, Zeevi & Sons v Grindlays
Bank [Uganda], 37 N.Y.2d 220, 227; Kilberg v Northeast
Airlines, 9 N.Y.2d 34, 40, supra.) Likewise, the
commentators have recognized the validity, indeed the
wisdom and propriety of the forum state's refusal, on
public policy grounds, to apply an anachronistic or
aberrant rule of the foreign State whose law would
otherwise apply. (See, e.g., Weintraub, supra, §§ 6.6,
6.27; Leflar, American Conflicts Law § 107, at 214 [3d
ed]; Freund, Chief Justice Stone and The Conflict of
Laws, 59 Harv L Rev 1210, 1216; Paulsen & Sovern,
"Public Policy" in the Conflict of Laws, 56 Colum L Rev
969; Cheatham & Reese, Choice of the Applicable Law,
52 Colum L Rev 959, 980; Restatement [Second] of
Conflict of Laws § 6 [2] [b], [e]; Juenger, supra, at 230-
235.) Similarly, the courts of other jurisdictions have
noted the imperative of avoiding application of a foreign
state's law that is repugnant to the forum state's public
policy or that is fairly deemed to be obsolete or
senseless. (See, e.g., Clark v Clark, 107 N.H. 351, 355,
222 A.2d 205, 209; Conklin v Horner, 38 Wis.2d 468,
484-485, 157 N.W.2d 579, 587; see also, Tiernan v
Westext Transp., 295 F.Supp. 1256; Skahill v Capital
Airlines, 234 F.Supp. 906, 907; Schneider v Nichols, 280
Minn. 139, 158 N.W.2d 254; Mitchell v Craft, 211 So.2d
509 [Miss]; Arnett v Thompson, 433 S.W.2d 109 [Ky].)
As this court has already held, the charitable immunity
law is one which is anachronistic, obsolete and senseless,
and it appears that there is virtual judicial unanimity
among the States that this is so. (See, Prosser and
Keeton, Torts § 133, at 1070 [5th ed]; Ann., 25 ALR2d
29; 25 ALR4th 517; see also, Restatement [Second] of
Torts § 895E, providing that charities ought not to be
immunized.) It is not surprising, therefore, that other
courts which have considered the immunity doctrine in
a conflict of laws context have held that its application
should be avoided as violative of New York's public
policy. (See, e.g., Rosenthal v Warren, 374 F.Supp. 522,
525-526; Rakaric v Croatian Cultural Club, 76 A.D.2d
619; Dowd v Boy Scouts of Am., [65 N.Y.2d 212] NYLJ,
Mar. 21, 1984, p 13, col 1 [Trial Term, Kings County];
cf.Pearson v Northeast Airlines, 309 F.2d 553, 561.) This
court ought now to hold the same. Having already held
that charitable immunity is "out of tune with the life
about us, at variance with modern-day needs and with
concepts of justice and fair dealing" (Bing v Thunig,
supra, at p 667 [emphasis added]), it would now be
incongruous, in my view, for this court to apply it here
to deny compensatory justice to nonresidents who were
injured while vacationing in New York.
Finally, I find no merit to defendants' arguments for the
application of collateral estoppel. First, as the majority
acknowledges, collateral estoppel is not a bar to a second
action in a different forum where the latter applies its
own law or refuses to give effect to the law of the first
forum on public policy grounds. (See, Gilberg v
Barbieri, 53 N.Y.2d 285, 292; Restatement [Second] of
Judgments § 29.) Inasmuch as New York law should be
applied in this case by reason of this State's significant
interests and because application of New Jersey's law
would contravene this State's public policy, collateral
estoppel is inapplicable. Secondly, plaintiffs' allegations,
the parties, and the precise issue in this litigation — i.e.,
whether New York law provides plaintiffs with a
remedy for injuries suffered in this State from
defendants' alleged tort-feasance — are not the same as
those involved in the prior litigation in New Jersey.
(See, Schultz v Roman Catholic Archdiocese, 95 N.J.
530, 472 A.2d 531.) Necessarily then, the prerequisites
to the application of collateral estoppel have not been
satisfied. (See, Ryan v New York Tel. Co., 62 N.Y.2d
494, 500-501; Schwartz v Public Administrator, 24
N.Y.2d 65, 71.)
For all these reasons, I would reverse the order of the
Appellate Division, apply the law of New York denying
immunity to defendant charities, and permit plaintiffs to
proceed on their complaint.
Order affirmed, with costs.
