Particularly in light of my Brother BLACK's dissent, I
think it not amiss for me to make explicit the precise
basis on which I join the Court's opinion. The
"property" of which petitioner has been deprived is the
use of the garnished portion of her wages during the
interim period between the garnishment and the
culmination of the main suit. Since this deprivation
cannot be characterized as de minimis, she must be
accorded the usual requisites of procedural due process:
notice and a prior hearing.
The rejoinder which this statement of position has
drawn from my Brother BLACK prompts an additional
word. His and my divergence in this case rests, I think,
upon a basic difference over whether the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits state action
by norms of "fundamental fairness" whose content in
any given instance is to be judicially derived not alone,
as my colleague believes it should be, from the specifics
of the Constitution, but also, as I believe, from concepts
[395 U.S. 343]
 which are part of the Anglo-American
legal heritageâ€” not, as my Brother BLACK continues to
insist, from the mere predilections of individual judges.
From my standpoint, I do not consider that the
requirements of "notice" and "hearing" are satisfied by
the fact that the petitioner was advised of the
garnishment simultaneously with the garnishee, or by
the fact that she will not permanently lose the garnished
property until after a plenary adverse adjudication of the
underlying claim against her, or by the fact that relief
from the garnishment may have been available in the
interim under less than clear circumstances. Compare
the majority and dissenting opinions in the Wisconsin
Supreme Court, 37 Wis.2d 163, 178, 154 N.W.2d 259,
267 (1967). Apart from special situations, some of which
are referred to in this Court's opinion, see ante, at 339, I
think that due process is afforded only by the kinds of
"notice" and "hearing" which are aimed at establishing
the validity, or at least the probable validity, of the
underlying claim against the alleged debtor before he
can be deprived of his property or its unrestricted use. I
think this is the thrust of the past cases in this Court.
See, e. g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., 339
U.S. 306, 313 (1950); Opp Cotton Mills v.
Administrator, 312 U.S. 126, 152-153 (1941); United
States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934);
Londoner v. City & County of Denver, 210 U.S. 373,
385-386 (1908).

 And I am 
[395 U.S. 344]
 quite
unwilling to take the unexplicated per curiam in McKay
v. McInnes, 279 U.S. 820 (1929), as vitiating or diluting
these essential elements of due process.
