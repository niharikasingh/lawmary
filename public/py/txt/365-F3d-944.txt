Gregory and Tracey Cummings brought this suit against
General Motors Corporation ("GM") to recover for
injuries Mrs. Cummings sustained in an automobile
accident involving a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am. The
Cummings allege that Mrs. Cummings's injuries
resulted from a flawed seat belt system and seat designed
by GM, as well as inadequate warnings of the dangers
inherent in the product. A jury returned a verdict in
favor of GM, and the Cummings appeal, asserting that
the court should have directed a verdict in their favor
based on the evidence, and that the district court abused
its discretion with regard to several discovery rulings.
Approximately eight months after the trial, the
Cummings filed a motion in the district court for relief
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) based on
alleged discovery misconduct on GM's part. The district
[365 F.3d 947] court denied relief, and the Cummings
appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291
over both appeals and consider them in turn below,
affirming in all respects.
Background
Gregory and Tracey Cummings were involved in a car
accident on the evening of September 13, 1998 in rural
Carter County, Oklahoma. Mr. Cummings was driving
a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am with his wife, Tracey, in the
front passenger seat. Their children were in the back
seat, with the three-month-old in a car seat behind Mrs.
Cummings. Mr. Cummings ran a "partially obscured"
stop sign at a T-type intersection and drove off the road,
through a ditch, and into a field. I Aplt.App. at 191.
Although the other passengers sustained only minor
injuries, Mrs. Cummings sustained a compression
fracture of the third vertebra resulting in paraplegia. I
Aplt. Br. at 12.
The Cummings brought this suit against GM, asserting
that Mrs. Cummings sustained such severe injuries as a
result of the design of the seat belt and the seat, as well
as GM's failure to warn. Prior to trial, the parties
engaged in multiple discovery disputes, including
disputes over the adequacy of responses to requests for
production, expert witness designations, depositions,
and electronic discovery. See I Aplt.App. at 17-37. These
disputes resulted in three motions to compel by the
Cummings and several motions for protective orders by
GM. The magistrate judge addressed the majority of
these disputes in an order dated June 18, 2002, in which
the judge denied Plaintiffs' motions, granted Defendant's
motions for protective orders, and granted Defendant's
their attorney's fees and costs. Id. The district court
reviewed the Plaintiffs' motions de novo and affirmed
the magistrate's findings in all respects. Id. at 3.
At trial, GM countered the Cummings' claims with
evidence that there was no defect in either the seat, the
seat belt system, or the warning. See id. at 714-15, 725,
865, 889-90, 1030-32. GM contended that Mrs.
Cummings's injuries resulted not from any defect, but
rather from a combination of the forces exerted on her
during the accident and her position and posture at the
time of the accident. Although the Cummings offered
evidence that Mrs. Cummings had her seat angled back
approximately 25 degrees, id. at 157, 524, GM's experts
testified that she was most likely reclined at 40-45
degrees at the time of the accident, id. at 689; sitting
slouched in the seat, id. at 686-87, 900-02; and/or
turned to attend to the children in the back seat, I Aplee.
Supp.App. at 316. The Cummings argued that such a
conclusion was impossible because there was a rearfacing
child safety seat located behind Mrs. Cummings
that prevented her from reclining her seat. GM offered
evidence that the child seat was actually installed in a
forward-facing direction at the time of the accident, thus
allowing the front passenger seat to recline.
At the close of all the evidence, out of the presence and
hearing of the jury, both the Cummings and GM moved
for judgment as a matter of law. I Aplt.App. at 1041-49.
GM made its motion first, moving for judgment as a
matter of law with regard to all claims, including the
alleged defective seat, seat belt, failure to warn, and
punitive damages claims. The Cummings responded to
GM's contentions, and then the court directed them to
make their motion for judgment as a matter of law.
Counsel for the Cummings stated:
Your Honor, I would move for judgment as a matter of law on the
foreseeable misuse or the so-called misuse defense. [365 F.3d 948]
Throughout the trial we have had to listen to [General Motors]
accuse Mrs. Cummings of reclining the seat. I don't need to tell
Your Honor. Your Honor knows foreseeable misuse is not a
defense. No one denies that this is foreseeable misuse of a seat. No
one denies that they built the capability into the seat to do it. They
knew the risk, that they knew people would be injured if they did
that. No one whatsoever denies that in this trial. This jury should
be instructed that reclining the seat is not a defense, and that if this
Defendant built a recliner seat that is dangerous, this Defendant
should be held legally responsible for the consequences. That's the
law in Oklahoma.
Id. at 1047-48. The court denied both motions.
The jury returned a verdict for GM, finding GM not
liable for any design defect or failure to warn. I Aplee.
Supp.App. at 324. The Cummings failed to make any
motions following the return of the verdict. Id. at 327.
The Cummings filed a timely appeal, asserting that (1)
they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law with
regard to liability, and (2) the trial court abused its
discretion in its rulings on various discovery motions.
One month after the verdict, and after filing the appeal,
the Cummings discovered six videos of child safety seat
acceleration tests conducted by GM and produced by
GM in an unrelated trial. The videos show tests by GM
involving child-sized dummies in forward-facing child
car seats placed in the back seat. In the videos, the
children are thrown from the car seat during various
accident simulations. The Cummings argue the tests fall
within their prior requests for production and would
have demonstrated that it was impossible for Mrs.
Cummings to have her seat fully reclined at the time of
the accident, as their child would have been injured had
the child been in a forward-facing child restraint.
The Cummings did not immediately move for relief
upon discovery of the videos. Instead, they waited seven
months to file a motion for relief under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 60(b). The district court, finding the
motion both untimely and lacking in support, denied
the motion, and the Cummings appeal. The appeals
have been consolidated and are addressed jointly below.
Discussion
A. Preserving Appellate Review of Sufficiency of the
Evidence
The Cummings assert the trial court erred in not
granting judgment in their favor, arguing that the
"[e]vidence of defect and causation presented at trial
entitled [them] to judgment as a matter of law." I Aplt.
Br. at 26. GM contends that the Cummings have failed
to preserve this issue for appeal, stating (1) the
Cummings moved for judgment as a matter of law at the
close of evidence only on the defense of product misuse
and not on liability generally, and (2) the Cummings
failed to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of
law after the verdict. I Aplee. Br. at 5, 6.
A party challenging the sufficiency of the evidence
during a civil trial must make a motion for judgment as
a matter of law before the case is submitted to the jury,
in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
50(a). "If, for any reason, the court does not grant a
motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the
close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have
submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's
later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion."
Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b). If the court denies the motion and
submits the case to the jury, the party may nevertheless
renew its motion [365 F.3d 949] after the verdict if the
jury finds for the opposing party or fails to reach a
verdict. Id.
Because a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the
close of evidence and following a verdict are closely
intertwined, we consider both in turn. A motion for
judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence,
formerly referred to as a motion for a directed verdict,
serves several purposes. Anderson v. United Tel. Co. of
Kan., 933 F.2d 1500, 1503 (10th Cir.1991) (collecting
cases). A motion under Rule 50(a) protects the Seventh
Amendment right to trial by jury. Such a motion alerts
the opposing party to any deficiencies in the case,
thereby giving the party an opportunity to rectify any
deficiencies prior to the case being submitted to the jury.
Id. A motion for judgment as a matter of law also alerts
the court to a claim of insufficient evidence before the
case is submitted to the jury so the court is not faced
with such a claim after the fact when the court's ability
to address the motion is limited. Id. Finally, a motion at
the close of evidence preserves the issue as a question of
law for appeal. Id.
These purposes are met when the moving party alerts
the court and the opposing party to the insufficiency of
the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.
Greenwood v. Societe Francaise De, 111 F.3d 1239,
1244-45 (5th Cir.1997). Upon such a motion, the court
"may grant a directed verdict only if the evidence points
but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable
inferences which may support the opposing party's
position," with the evidence and inferences construed in
the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Q.E.R., Inc. v. Hickerson, 880 F.2d 1178, 1180 (10th
Cir.1989). On appeal, this court reviews de novo the
district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a
matter of law, Cadena v. Pacesetter Corp., 224 F.3d
1203, 1208 (10th Cir.2000), applying the same standard
as applied in the district court, Q.E.R., 880 F.2d at 1180.
"[W]e ... will reverse only if there is no legally sufficient
evidentiary basis ... with respect to a claim or defense ...
under the controlling law.'" Cadena, 224 F.3d at 1208
(internal quotations and citations omitted).
Where a party fails to move for judgment as a matter of
law before the close of the evidence, however, we have
repeatedly held that such a failure bars appellate review
of the sufficiency of the evidence. F.D.I.C. v. United Pac.
Ins. Co., 20 F.3d 1070, 1076 (10th Cir.1994); Green
Constr. Co. v. Kan. Power & Light Co., 1 F.3d 1005,
1012 (10th Cir.1993); Comcoa, Inc. v. NEC Tels., Inc.,
931 F.2d 655, 663 n. 11 (10th Cir.1991). The motion
must also be sufficiently certain as to the issues raised.
Rule 50(a) requires that a motion for judgment as a
matter of law at the close of the evidence "specify the
judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the
moving party is entitled to the judgment." Fed.R.Civ.P.
50(a)(2). The motion must include all issues challenged,
as the "failure to move for a directed verdict [now
judgment as a matter of law] on a particular issue will
bar appellate review of that issue." Davoll v. Webb, 194
F.3d 1116, 1136 (10th Cir.1999).
When determining whether a particular issue has been
raised in a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the
court has liberally construed such motions, Aguinaga v.
United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, 993
F.2d 1463, 1470 (10th Cir.1993), stating that "[t]echnical
precision is not necessary in stating grounds for the
motion so long as the trial court is aware of the
movant's position," United States v. Fenix & Scisson,
Inc., 360 F.2d 260, 266 (10th Cir.1966); see also
Anderson, 933 F.2d at 1504. While technical [365 F.3d
950] precision is not required, "merely moving for
directed verdict is not sufficient to preserve any and all
issues that could have been, but were not raised in the
directed verdict motion." United Int'l Holdings, Inc. v.
Wharf Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1229 (10th Cir.2000). Rule
50 "does require that [the grounds for a motion] be
stated with sufficient certainty to apprise the court and
opposing counsel of the movant's position with respect
to the motion." Id.
In this case, the Cummings moved for judgment as a
matter of law with regard to the defense of misuse only
and requested a jury instruction on this issue. Counsel
did not move for judgment as a matter of law with
regard to GM's liability generally. The Cummings assert
that the motion should be read liberally in accordance
with Aguinaga to include the issue of liability generally.
Although technical precision is not required, the
moving party must adequately notify the court of the
issues being raised in order to satisfy the purposes of the
rule. The Plaintiffs' motion was limited to a motion for
judgment as a matter of law on the issue of misuse, and
therefore any appeal is so limited. See Dilley v.
SuperValu, Inc., 296 F.3d 958, 962 (10th Cir.2002);
Smith v. Northwest Fin. Acceptance, Inc., 129 F.3d
1408, 1415-16 (10th Cir.1997); United Pac. Ins., 20 F.3d
at 1076. Beyond the issue of foreseeable misuse, we are
limited to review for "`plain error constituting a
miscarriage of justice.'" Dilley, 296 F.3d at 962 (quoting
First Sec. Bank v. Taylor, 964 F.2d 1053, 1057 (10th
Cir.1992)); see also Smith, 129 F.3d at 1416.
GM also asserts that the Cummings' failure to renew
their motion after the verdict results in a waiver. While
true in most circuits,1 under Tenth Circuit precedent,
even where a party fails to make a post-verdict motion
for judgment as a matter of law, it is not barred from
appealing the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence, at
least where an appropriate motion has been made prior
to the submission of the case to the jury. See Morrison
Knudsen Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 175 F.3d
1221, 1246 (10th Cir.1999) (holding such a failure does
not bar appellant "from appealing the issue of the
sufficiency of the [365 F.3d 951] evidence"); Marshall v.
El Paso Natural Gas Co., 874 F.2d 1373, 1385 (10th
Cir.1989) (holding "failure to move for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict does not bar an appeal");
Hansen v. Vidal, 237 F.2d 453, 454 (10th Cir.1956)
(holding motion for judgment as a matter of law not a
"condition precedent to appeal from a final judgment").
Thus the Cummings' failure to move for judgment as a
matter of law following the adverse jury verdict does not
bar their appeal regarding the sufficiency of the evidence
to support the misuse defense.
In the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion, however, we are
limited in the relief we may grant. The Supreme Court
has repeatedly noted that in the absence of a motion for
judgment as a matter of law following an adverse jury
verdict "made in the trial court within ten days after
reception of a verdict [, Rule 50(b)] forbids the trial
judge or an appellate court to enter such a judgment."
Johnson, 344 U.S. at 50, 73 S.Ct. 125; see also Globe
Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332 U.S. 571, 574, 68 S.Ct.
246, 92 L.Ed. 177 (1948); Cone v. W. Va. Pulp & Paper
Co., 330 U.S. 212, 218, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947)
(holding appellate court is "without power to direct the
District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it
had permitted to stand"). Thus, "[t]his court has no
authority to direct a verdict contrary to that of the trial
court where, as here, the complaining party has not
given the trial court an opportunity to first correct its
own error." Fortier v. Dona Anna Plaza Partners, 747
F.2d 1324, 1334 (10th Cir.1984). In this situation, the
only remedy available is a new trial. Johnson, 344 U.S. at
50-51, 73 S.Ct. 125; Morrison Knudsen, 175 F.3d at
1246; Fortier, 747 F.2d at 1334.
As to whether the court should have granted the
Cummings judgment as a matter of law with regard to
GM's liability generally, because the Cummings' Rule
50(a) motion was limited to the issue of GM's misuse
defense, we review the sufficiency of the evidence only
for plain error constituting a miscarriage of justice. In
addition, we are limited to determining whether a new
trial is required, as we are without power to grant
judgment in the Cummings' favor. As noted previously,
judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only "if the
evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no
reasonable inferences which may support the opposing
party's position." Davis v. United States Postal Serv., 142
F.3d 1334, 1339 (10th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and
citations omitted). "This stringent standard of review is
further heightened under plain error review, which has
been limited to errors which seriously affect the fairness,
integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."
Dilley, 296 F.3d at 963 (internal quotations and citations
omitted). After a thorough review of the record in this
case, we find nothing that rises to the level of such a
miscarriage of justice. Therefore we conclude the
district court did not commit plain error in allowing the
Cummings' products liability claims to go to the jury.
We review the district court's denial of the Cummings'
motion for judgment as a matter of law as to GM's
defense of misuse de novo, although as above noted we
are limited to determining whether the Cummings are
entitled to a new trial. Under Oklahoma law, to establish
a manufacturer's product liability, a plaintiff must prove
that (1) "the product was the cause of the injury," (2) the
defect existed in the product "at the time the product left
the manufacturer's possession and control," and (3) "the
defect made the article unreasonably dangerous."
Kirkland v. Gen. Motors Corp., 521 P.2d 1353, 1363
(Okla.1975). However, where a plaintiff is using [365
F.3d 952] a product for a purpose for which it was not
intended, and is injured, the plaintiff may not recover.
Id. at 1366. Misuse of a product is a "defense subject to
being pleaded and proved by defendant." Stewart v.
Scott-Kitz Miller Co., 626 P.2d 329, 331
(Okla.App.1981). "Abnormal or misuse of a product
occurs where the method of using a product is not that
which the maker intended or is a use that could not
reasonably be anticipated by a manufacturer." Treadway
v. Uniroyal Tire Co., 766 P.2d 938, 941 (Okla.1988).
Oklahoma has drawn a distinction between "use for an
abnormal purpose" or misuse, and "use for a proper
purpose but in a careless manner." Id. Use for a proper
purpose but in a careless manner is considered
contributory negligence, id., and contributory
negligence is not a defense to a products liability claim,
Fields v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 555 P.2d 48, 56
(Okla.1976).
Although GM's main defense was that there was no
defect in the seat or seat restraint system, GM also
asserted that Mrs. Cummings's injuries may have
resulted from either her posture or position at the time
of the accident. GM presented evidence that Mrs.
Cummings was reclined in her seat and that the injury
resulted due to her position at the time of the accident.
GM presented evidence of a warning in the owner's
manual against such use, which contained a picture of a
person reclined and a warning that "[e]ven if you buckle
up, your safety belts can't do their job when you're
reclined like this." I Aplt.App. at 809. The experts
testified that riding with the seat reclined was not an
advised use of the seat given the warning and safety
concerns, id. at 406-07, and that the seat reclined for
uses while the car was parked rather than moving, id. at
760-61, 998. The Cummings countered with evidence
that such a use was foreseeable by manufacturers. I
Aplee. Supp.App. at 319. The Cummings' own
statements were that such a use was "unsafe" and that
Mrs. Cummings would never ride in this position. Id. at
154.
A motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of
the evidence may only be granted if "the evidence points
but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable
inferences which may support the opposing party's
position." Q.E.R., 880 F.2d at 1180. Construing the
evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to
GM, and refraining "from weighing the evidence,
passing on the credibility of witnesses, or substituting
our judgment for that of the jury," Brown v. Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., 11 F.3d 1559, 1563 (10th Cir.1993), we find
there was evidence supporting both parties' positions,
and consequently the court did not err in denying the
motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitting
the issue to the jury.
B. Discovery Rulings
With regard to the Cummings' appeal of the trial court's
discovery rulings, we discern three main arguments: (1)
GM failed to respond adequately to requests for
discovery; (2) GM withheld names and locations of
persons responsible for the design and implementation
of the seat system; and (3) GM failed timely to produce
research, development, and testing, including the failure
to provide access to GM's databases. I Aplt. Br. at 39-40.
The district court has broad discretion over the control
of discovery, and we will not set aside discovery rulings
absent an abuse of that discretion. GWN Petroleum
Corp. v. OK-Tex Oil & Gas, Inc., 998 F.2d 853, 858
(10th Cir.1993). This standard of review applies equally
to the denial of a motion to compel, Motley v. Marathon
Oil Co., 71 F.3d 1547, 1550 (10th Cir.1995) (noting a
denial of a motion to compel discovery will not be
disturbed [365 F.3d 953] absent an abuse of discretion),
and the grant of a protective order, Kidd v. Taos Ski
Valley, Inc., 88 F.3d 848, 853 (10th Cir.1996) ("The
decision of a district court to enter a protective order
under Rule 26(c) is reviewed for an abuse of
discretion."). Under this standard, "we will not disturb a
trial court's decision absent a definite and firm
conviction that the lower court made a clear error of
judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice
in the circumstances." Id. (internal quotations and
citations omitted). Such an abuse will occur only when
the judge renders "an arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or
manifestly unreasonable" judgment. Coletti v. Cudd
Pressure Control, 165 F.3d 767, 777 (10th Cir.1999)
(internal quotations and citations omitted).
We do not find such an abuse of discretion in this case.
The Cummings assert that GM abused the discovery
process and failed to adequately respond to discovery
requests, yet they fail to point to anything in the record
to support this proposition. We agree with the district
court's conclusion that "numerous miscommunications
and unnecessary disputes have been caused by Plaintiffs'
failure to frame precise discovery requests and notices in
accordance with the provisions of the rules." I Aplt.App.
at 24.
We similarly find no support for the Cummings'
assertion that GM failed to provide the names and
locations of persons, including a Mr. Zurkiwskyj,
responsible for the design and implementation of the
seat system. GM provided several representatives from
the company to be deposed under Rule 30(b)(6) on the
issues of the seat design, seat restraint system, and the
All-Belts-To-Seats design. I Aplt.App. at 27-28, 30. The
Cummings cannot place the blame on GM for their own
failure to depose the designated representatives.
To the extent the Cummings attempted to depose
specific individuals, their service of notice to GM was in
error. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6), a
party may issue a notice of intent to take a deposition to
an organization, and then the organization shall
designate "one or more officers, directors or managing
agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its
behalf." The corporate entity itself designates the
representative. Id. To the extent a party wants to
subpoena an individual of its choice for a deposition, it
must do so under Rule 30(a)(1), which states that a party
"may take the testimony of any person, including a
party, by deposition upon oral examination without
leave of court." Rule 30(a) allows the Cummings to take
the deposition of nonparty witnesses, including
employees. "Except where the employee has been
designated by the corporation under Rule 30(b)(6), an
employee is treated in the same way as any other
witness. His or her presence must be obtained by
subpoena rather than by notice...." 8A Wright, Miller &
Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure Civ.2d ยง 2103.
Mr. Zurkiwskyj's attendance must be compelled as any
other nonparty witness-by subpoena. Fed.R.Civ.P. 45.
The Cummings' reliance on Rule 26 is similarly
misplaced. The magistrate ruled the newest version of
Rule 26 would govern in this case, including the 2000
amendments, I Aplt.App. at 26 n. 5, and the Cummings
did not object to this holding. Under the 2000
amendments, a party's "initial disclosure obligation ...
has been narrowed." Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 advisory
committee's note, 2000 amends. Rule 26(a)(1) only
requires automatic disclosure of "the name and, if
known, the address and telephone number of each
individual likely to have discoverable information that
the disclosing party may use to support its claims or
defenses." Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1)(A). [365 F.3d 954]
Under this rule, a party is not obligated "to disclose
witnesses or documents, whether favorable or
unfavorable, that it does not intend to use." Fed.R.Civ.P.
26 advisory committee's note, 2000 amends.; see Gluck
v. Ansett Austl. Ltd., 204 F.R.D. 217, 221-22
(D.D.C.2001) (holding under the new version of Rule 26
that the opposing party was not required to produce
information with regard to potential witnesses because
"the essential inquiry is whether the disclosing party
intends to use the witness.").
Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of
the motion to compel access to GM's databases and the
grant of a protective order to GM. As noted by the
magistrate judge, "Plaintiffs' proposed computer
database searches are overly broad in scope, duplicative
of prior requests and unduly burdensome." I Aplt.App.
at 35. "It is the unusual or exceptional case where the
reviewing court will vacate a protective order entered
by a trial court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)," In re
Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prods.
Antitrust Litig., 669 F.2d 620, 623 (10th Cir.1982), and
there is no support for such a conclusion in this case.
Rather than an abuse of discretion, the record reveals a
thorough and reasoned disposition on the part of the
court, especially given the multiple motions before the
court and the breakdown of communication between
the parties.
C. Rule 60(b) Motion
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides that
"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court
may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from
a final judgment, order or proceeding for ... fraud ...,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse
party." We review a district court's denial of a Rule
60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. Amoco Oil Co.
v. EPA, 231 F.3d 694, 697 (10th Cir.2000); see also
Stubblefield v. Windsor Capital Group, 74 F.3d 990, 994
(10th Cir.1996) (collecting cases). In undertaking such a
review, we are guided by the principle that "[r]elief
under Rule 60(b) is extraordinary and may only be
granted in exceptional circumstances." Bud Brooks
Trucking, Inc. v. Bill Hodges Trucking Co., 909 F.2d
1437, 1440 (10th Cir.1990).
1. Timeliness of Rule 60(b) Motion
In denying the Cummings' Rule 60(b) motion, the
district court relied in part on counsel's delay in filing
the motion. II Aplt. Br., Att. 1 at 3-4. Rule 60 requires
that such a motion be "made within a reasonable time,
and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or
taken." Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Because the Cummings have
argued misconduct under Rule 60(b)(3), the motion
must have been filed within a "reasonable time," and not
more than a year after the judgment.
The Cummings filed the Rule 60(b) motion within a
year of the judgment. However, "[a] motion is not
timely merely because it has been filed within one year
of the judgment." White v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d
1414, 1425 (10th Cir.1990). The Cummings waited
seven months after discovery of the tests to file the
motion. This court has upheld several Rule 60(b) denials
based on delay where the motion was nevertheless filed
prior to the one year deadline. See White, 915 F.2d at
1425 (finding motion untimely where delay of almost a
year with only justification that party needed time to
raise a defense); Sec. Mutual Cas. Co. v. Century Cas.
Co., 621 F.2d 1062, 1067-68 (10th Cir.1980) (finding
motion untimely where unexplained delay of 115 days
after [365 F.3d 955] received notice of grounds for
motion). Where a party delays in filing a Rule 60(b)
motion after discovery of the grounds for the motion, it
must offer sufficient justification for the delay. White,
915 F.2d at 1425. The Cummings argue their motion
was presented in a "reasonable time in light of their
numerous attempts at securing relief through other
procedural channels." II Aplt. Br. at 20. However, the
Cummings fail to explain what "other procedural
channels" were explored. Id. at 20-21. They also state
that they did not want to rush for relief "lest they risk
the imposition of sanctions" under Rule 11. Id. at 21.
Although it is true Rule 11 imposes a duty on attorneys
to conduct "a reasonable inquiry" into the facts and law
prior to signing any pleading filed with the court,
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 392, 110
S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), the Cummings do
not explain why seven months were needed to conduct
such an inquiry. They merely assert that, given the
extraordinary nature of the remedy under Rule 60, they
did not want to rush into filing such a motion. Such an
assertion, without more, is insufficient to justify the
delay. See White, 915 F.2d at 1425 (concluding party's
asserted need for more time to assess defense was
insufficient justification for delay). Given this court's
precedent, and the failure of the Cummings to offer
sufficient justification for the delay, it was not an abuse
of the court's discretion to consider the Cummings'
delay in denying the motion.
2. Denial of Rule 60(b) Motion on Merits
In addition to finding the motion untimely, the district
court concluded that the motion should be denied "more
importantly, because the plaintiffs have failed to
establish misconduct by GMC." II Aplt. Br., Att. 1 at 4.
As noted above, "[r]elief under Rule 60(b) is
extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional
circumstances." Bud Brooks, 909 F.2d at 1440. Parties
seeking relief under Rule 60(b) have a higher hurdle to
overcome because such a motion is not a substitute for
an appeal. Id. Given the lower court's discretion, the
district court's ruling is only reviewed to determine if a
"definite, clear or unmistakable error occurred below."
Amoco Oil Co., 231 F.3d at 697. The burden is on the
moving party, Wilkin v. Sunbeam Corp., 466 F.2d 714,
717 (10th Cir.1972), and they must show "clear and
convincing proof" of fraud, misrepresentation, or
misconduct, Anderson v. Dep't of Health & Human
Servs., 907 F.2d 936, 952 (10th Cir.1990); Yapp v. Excel
Corp., 186 F.3d 1222, 1231 (10th Cir.1999). The
application must be "clearly substantiated by adequate
proof," Wilkin, 466 F.2d at 717, and the challenged
behavior must substantially have interfered with the
aggrieved party's ability fully and fairly to prepare for
and proceed at trial." Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v.
Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985, 993 (10th
Cir.1999)(internal quotation marks and citations
omitted).
Failure to disclose information requested during
discovery may constitute "misconduct" under Rule
60(b)(3). Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut.
Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985, 993 (10th Cir.1999).
However, the Cummings have failed to provide clear
and convincing evidence that GM's failure to disclose
the videos in this case constitutes misconduct. The
Cummings assert that the videos in question show
"infant-sized crash dummies squirt[ing] out of their
safety seats in simulated accidents similar to that
suffered by the Cummings," II Aplt. Br. at 6; they argue
such evidence would have been crucial in countering
GM's defense, as the videos show that a scenario
involving a forward facing child seat would have
resulted in injury to the infant in this case. GM counters
that the videos are irrelevant, as they involve child
dummies ages [365 F.3d 956] three and above, in
dissimilar car seats, in dissimilar cars. II Aplee. Br. at 14-
15.
Even assuming the videos were relevant, GM was under
no duty to produce the videos given the requests for
production in this case. Plaintiffs offer various requests
for production and a subpoena duces tecum, arguing the
tests fall within the requested documents. However, the
requests are either overly broad or focus solely on the
"seat, shoulder anchorages, seat bottom/pan, the seat
back, the seat belt anchorages and seat belt angles." II
Aplt.App. at 123-24. The Cummings have failed to point
to any discovery requests that would encompass the
videos in question.
This is particularly true given that the scope of the
discovery in this case was limited to 1992-1998 N-cars,
which included the 1995 Pontiac Grand Am. The
magistrate judge stated during discovery that
"[i]nformation about "N" cars that do not share
pertinent designs and component parts with the car
model at issue would not be relevant to the claims and
defenses in this case." I Aplee. Br. at 18 (quoting I
Aplt.App. at 34). Given the scope of discovery set forth
by the district court, it does not appear the failure to
produce the videos in response to the Cummings'
discovery requests was "misconduct" on the part of GM.
The Cummings point to two cases, Anderson v.
Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 925-26 (1st Cir.1988), and
Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th
Cir.1978), to support their argument that GM's conduct
constituted "misconduct." We are unpersuaded. The
particular documents at issue in those cases were clearly
requested during discovery. In Anderson, the court
specifically found that "[e]ach and all of these Rule 34
demands, fairly read, necessitated divulgement of the
Report." 862 F.2d at 928. In Rozier, the court
determined that "[b]y any fair reading, the district
court's ... discovery order called for production of this
Trend Cost Estimate." 573 F.2d at 1339. These cases
merely stand for the principle that the failure to disclose
in response to a request for production, where proven
with clear and convincing evidence, may constitute
misconduct under Rule 60(b)(3).
We similarly find lacking the Cummings' argument that
GM was required to disclose the video tapes under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. To the extent the
Cummings argue GM is required to automatically
produce any document "relevant" to the disputed facts at
issue in this case, see II Aplee. Br. at 10-11, as discussed
above, their reference to the prior version of the rule is
inappropriate. Rule 26(a)(1) requires that parties make
initial disclosures of "all documents, data compilations,
and tangible things that are in the possession, custody,
or control of the party and that the disclosing party may
use to support its claim or defenses, unless solely for
impeachment." Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1)(B). Under the
applicable version of the rule, GM was not required to
automatically disclose documents that it did not intend
to use. Id., advisory committee's note, 2000 amends.
Although a party "may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or
defense of any party" under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 26(b)(1), it is the party's own responsibility to
seek such discovery through depositions and
interrogatories.
The Cummings argue that "the letter and the spirit of
the federal rules" require a new trial in this case. II Aplt.
Br. at 22. The policies of full and fair disclosure,
however, do not relieve them of their burden to prove
misconduct. The district court concluded that the
Cummings failed to satisfy this burden. Given the
extraordinary nature of this remedy, and the lack [365
F.3d 957] of support for the motion, this conclusion was
not an abuse of discretion. All outstanding motions are
denied.
AFFIRMED.
