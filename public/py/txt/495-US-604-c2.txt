I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally permits
a state [495 U.S. 629] court to exercise jurisdiction over a
defendant if he is served with process while voluntarily
present in the forum State.1 I do not perceive the need,
however, to decide that a jurisdictional rule that " `has
been immemorially the actual law of the land,' " ante, at
619, quoting Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 528
(1884), automatically comports with due process simply
by virtue of its "pedigree." Although I agree that history
is an important factor in establishing whether a
jurisdictional rule satisfies due process requirements, I
cannot agree that it is the only factor such that all
traditional rules of jurisdiction are, ipso facto, forever
constitutional. Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, I would
undertake an "independent inquiry into the . . . fairness
of the prevailing in-state service rule." Ante, at 621. I
therefore concur only in the judgment.
I
I believe that the approach adopted by JUSTICE
SCALIA's opinion today — reliance solely on historical
pedigree — is foreclosed by our decisions in
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310
(1945), and Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977). In
International Shoe, we held that a state court's assertion
of personal jurisdiction does not violate the Due Process
Clause if it is consistent with " `traditional notions of
fair play and substantial justice.' " 326 U. S., at 316,
quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940).2 In
Shaffer, we stated that "all assertions of state-court
jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the
standards set forth in International Shoe and its
progeny." 433 [495 U.S. 630] U. S., at 212 (emphasis
added). The critical insight of Shaffer is that all rules of
jurisdiction, even ancient ones, must satisfy
contemporary notions of due process. No longer were
we content to limit our jurisdictional analysis to
pronouncements that "[t]he foundation of jurisdiction is
physical power," McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U.S. 90, 91
(1917), and that "every State possesses exclusive
jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property
within its territory." Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 722
(1878). While acknowledging that "history must be
considered as supporting the proposition that
jurisdiction based solely on the presence of property
satisfied[d] the demands of due process," we found that
this factor could not be "decisive." 433 U. S., at 211-212.
We recognized that " `[t]raditional notions of fair play
and substantial justice' can be as readily offended by the
perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer
justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are
inconsistent with the basic values of our constitutional
heritage." Id., at 212 (citations omitted). I agree with this
approach and continue to believe that "the minimumcontacts
analysis developed in International Shoe . . .
represents a far more sensible construct for the exercise
of state-court jurisdiction than the patchwork of legal
and factual fictions that has been generated from the
decision in Pennoyer v. Neff." Id., at 219 (BRENNAN, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation
omitted).
While our holding in Shaffer may have been limited to
quasi in rem jurisdiction, our mode of analysis was not.
Indeed, that we were willing in Shaffer to examine anew
the appropriateness of the quasi in rem rule — until that
time dutifully accepted by American courts for at least a
century — demonstrates that we did not believe that the
"pedigree" of a jurisdictional practice was dispositive in
deciding whether it was consistent with due process.
We later characterized Shaffer as "abandon[ing] the
outworn rule of Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), that
the interest of a creditor in a debt [495 U.S. 631] could be
extinguished or otherwise affected by any State having
transitory jurisdiction over the debtor." World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 296
(1980); see also Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.S. 320, 325-326
(1980). If we could discard an "ancient form without
substantial modern justification" in Shaffer, supra, at
212, we can do so again.3 Lower courts,4
commentators,5 and the American Law Institute6 [495
U.S. 632] all have interpreted International Shoe and
Shaffer to mean that every assertion of state-court
jurisdiction, even one pursuant to a "traditional" rule
such as transient jurisdiction, must comport with
contemporary notions of due process. Notwithstanding
the nimble gymnastics of JUSTICE [495 U.S. 633]
SCALIA's opinion today, it is not faithful to our decision
in Shaffer.
II
Tradition, though alone not dispositive, is of course
relevant to the question whether the rule of transient
jurisdiction is consistent with due process.7 Tradition is
salient not in the sense that practices of the past are
automatically reasonable today; indeed, under such a
standard, the legitimacy of transient jurisdiction would
be called into question because the rule's historical
"pedigree" is a matter of intense debate. The rule was a
stranger to the common law8 and was rather [495 U.S.
634] weakly implanted in American jurisprudence "at
the crucial time for present purposes: 1868, when the
Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Ante, at 611. For
much of the 19th century, American courts did not
uniformly recognize the concept of transient
jurisdiction,9 and it appears that the [495 U.S. 635]
transient rule did not receive wide currency until well
after our decision in Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714
(1878).10
Rather, I find the historical background relevant
because, however murky the jurisprudential origins of
transient jurisdiction, [495 U.S. 636] the fact that
American courts have announced the rule for perhaps a
century (first in dicta, more recently in holdings)
provides a defendant voluntarily present in a particular
State today "clear notice that [he] is subject to suit" in
[495 U.S. 637] the forum. World-Wide Volkswagen
Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S., at 297. Regardless of
whether Justice Story's account of the rule's genesis is
mythical, our common understanding now, fortified by
a century of judicial practice, is that jurisdiction is often
a function of geography. The transient rule is consistent
with reasonable expectations and is entitled to a strong
presumption that it comports with due process. "If I
visit another State, . . . I knowingly assume some risk
that the State will exercise its power over my property
or my person while there. My contact with the State,
though minimal, gives rise to predictable risks." Shaffer,
433 U. S., at 218 (STEVENS, J., concurring in
judgment); see also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,
471 U.S. 462, 476 (1985) ("[T]erritorial presence
frequently will enhance a potential defendant's
affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable
foreseeability of suit there"); Glen, An Analysis of "Mere
Presence" and Other Traditional Bases of Jurisdiction,
45 Brooklyn L. Rev. 607, 611-612 (1979). Thus,
proposed revisions to the Restatement (Second) of
Conflict of Laws § 28, p. 39 (1986), provide that "[a]
state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an
individual who is present within its territory unless the
individual's relationship to the state is so attenuated as
to make the exercise of such jurisdiction
unreasonable."11
By visiting the forum State, a transient defendant
actually "avail[s]" himself, Burger King, supra, at 476, of
significant benefits provided by the State. His health and
safety are guaranteed by the State's police, fire, and
emergency medical services; he is free to travel on the
State's roads and water-ways; [495 U.S. 638] he likely
enjoys the fruits of the State's economy as well.
Moreover, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
Article IV prevents a state government from
discriminating against a transient defendant by denying
him the protections of its law or the right of access to its
courts.12 See Supreme Court of New Hampshire v.
Piper, 470 U.S. 274, 281, n. 10 (1985); Baldwin v.
Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, 436 U.S. 371, 387
(1978); see also Supreme Court of Virginia v. Friedman,
487 U.S. 59, 64-65 (1988). Subject only to the doctrine
of forum non conveniens, an out-of-state plaintiff may
use state courts in all circumstances in which those
courts would be available to state citizens. Without
transient jurisdiction, an asymmetry would arise: A
transient would have the full benefit of the power of the
forum State's courts as a plaintiff while retaining
immunity from their authority as a defendant. See
Maltz, Sovereign Authority, Fairness, and Personal
Jurisdiction: The Case for the Doctrine of Transient
Jurisdiction, 66 Wash. U. L. Q. 671, 698-699 (1988).
The potential burdens on a transient defendant are
slight. " `[M]odern transportation and communications
have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to
defend himself' " in a State outside his place of residence.
Burger King, supra, at 474, quoting McGee v.
International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223 (1957).
That the defendant has already journeyed [495 U.S. 639]
at least once before to the forum — as evidenced by the
fact that he was served with process there — is an
indication that suit in the forum likely would not be
prohibitively inconvenient. Finally, any burdens that do
arise can be ameliorated by a variety of procedural
devices.13 For these reasons, as a rule the exercise of
personal jurisdiction over a defendant based on his
voluntary presence in the forum will satisfy the
requirements of due process.14 See n. 11, supra.
[495 U.S. 640] In this case, it is undisputed that
petitioner was served with process while voluntarily and
knowingly in the State of California. I therefore concur
in the judgment.
