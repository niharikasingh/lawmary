Petitioner contends that in 1964 respondent, while
acting "under color of . . . statute" or "under color of . . .
custom, or usage" of the State of Mississippi, subjected
her to the deprivation of her right under the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment not to
be denied service in respondent's restaurant due to racial
discrimination in which the State of Mississippi was
involved, and that therefore respondent is liable to her
in damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. To recover under
§ 1983 petitioner must prove two separate and
independent elements: first, that respondent subjected
her to the [398 U.S. 189] deprivation of a right "secured
by the Constitution and laws"; and, second, that while
doing so respondent acted under color of a statute,
ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State of
Mississippi.
Whether a person suing under § 1983 must show state
action in the first element—the deprivation of a right
"secured by the Constitution and laws"—depends on the
nature of the particular right asserted. For example, a
person may be deprived of a right secured by the
Constitution and 42 U. S. C. § 1982 by a private person
acting completely independently of state government.
See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968).
On the other hand, the constitutional right to equal
protection of the laws, unelaborated by any statute, can
be violated only by action involving a State. The
discussion in United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 249-
252 (1876) (Hunt, J., dissenting), of various
constitutional uses of the word "State" suggests that as
an original matter "State" in the Equal Protection Clause
might have been interpreted in any of several ways.
Moreover, some have thought that historical evidence
points to an interpretation covering some categories of
state inaction in the face of wholly private conduct, see,
e. g., Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 286-316 (1964)
(Goldberg, J., concurring); R. Harris, The Quest for
Equality 24-56 (1960); J. tenBroek, Equal Under Law
201-239 (1965). However, our cases have held that the
Equal Protection Clause applies only to action by state
government or officials and those significantly involved
with them. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948);
Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,
721-722 (1961). Whether and when a person suing
under § 1983 must show state action in the second
element—action under color of a statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or [398 U.S. 190] usage of a
State—depends on an analysis of the text, legislative
history, and policy of § 1983. See Part II, infra. These
two inquiries are wholly different, thought in particular
cases a showing of state action under one element may
suffice under the other.
In the present case petitioner alleged as the first element
under § 1983 a deprivation of her right to equal
protection. Therefore, under our cases, she must show
state action. She asserts that there was state action in
two different respects. First, she contends that there was
a conspiracy between respondent and local police to
discriminate against her in restaurant service because
she, a white person, sought service while accompanied
by Negro friends. The Court treats this aspect of her
claim in Part I of its opinion, which I join.1 Petitioner
contends, alternatively, that respondent's discrimination
was authorized and encouraged by Mississippi statutes.
To that contention I now turn.
I
The state-action doctrine reflects the profound
judgment that denials of equal treatment, and
particularly denials on account of race or color, are
singularly grave when government has or shares
responsibility for them. Government is the social organ
to which all in our society look for the promotion of
liberty, justice, fair and equal treatment, and the setting
of worthy norms and goals for social conduct. Therefore
something is uniquely amiss in a society where the
government, the authoritative oracle of community
values, involves itself in racial [398 U.S. 191]
discrimination. Accordingly, in the cases that have come
before us this Court has condemned significant state
involvement in racial discrimination, however subtle
and indirect it may have been and whatever form it may
have taken. See, e. g., Burton v. Wilmington Parking
Authority, supra; Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966);
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969). These
decisions represent vigilant fidelity to the constitutional
principle that no State shall in any significant way lend
its authority to the sordid business of racial
discrimination.
Among the state-action cases that most nearly resemble
the present one are the sit-in cases decided in 1963 and
1964. In Peterson v. City of Greenville, 373 U.S. 244
(1963), the petitioners were convicted of trespass for
refusing to leave a lunch counter at a Kress store in
South Carolina. A Greenville ordinance at that time
imposed on the proprietors of restaurants the duty to
segregate the races in their establishments, and there
was evidence that the Kress manager was aware of the
ordinance. We held that the existence of the ordinance,
together with a showing that the Kress manager
excluded the petitioners solely because they were
Negroes, was sufficient to constitute discriminatory
state action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment:
"When the State has commanded a particular result, it has saved to
itself the power to determine that result and thereby `to a
significant extent' has `become involved' in it, and, in fact, has
removed that decision from the sphere of private choice. . . .
"Consequently these convictions cannot stand, even assuming, as
respondent contends, that the manager would have acted as he did
independently of the existence of the ordinance." 373 U. S., at 248.
[398 U.S. 192] Although the case involved trespass
convictions, the Court did not rely on the State's
enforcement of its neutral trespass laws in analyzing the
elements of state action present. Nor did it cite Shelley v.
Kraemer, supra, the logical starting point for an analysis
in terms of judicial enforcement. The denial of equal
protection occurred when the petitioners were denied
service in the restaurant. That denial of equal protection
tainted the subsequent convictions. And as we noted in
Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 380 (1967), no "proof
[was] required that the restaurant owner had actually
been influenced by the state statute . . . ." Thus Peterson
establishes the proposition that where a State commands
a class of persons to discriminate on the basis of race,
discrimination by a private person within that class is
state action, regardless of whether he was motivated by
the command. The Court's intimation in the present
case that private discrimination might be state action
only where the private person acted under compulsion
imposed by the State echoes MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S
argument in Peterson that private discrimination is state
action only where the State motivates the private person
to discriminate. See 373 U. S., at 251-253. That
argument was squarely rejected by the Court in
Peterson, and I see no reason to resurrect it now.
The rationale of Peterson was extended in Lombard v.
Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267 (1963). There the petitioners
were convicted of trespass for refusing to leave a
restaurant after being denied service. Prior to the arrests
the mayor and superintendent of police of New Orleans
had publicly stated that sit-in demonstrations were
undesirable and that relevant trespass laws would be
fully enforced. Although these statements, unlike the
ordinance in Peterson, were not discriminatory on their
face, the Court interpreted them [398 U.S. 193] as
evidencing state support for the system of racial
segregation prevalent in the private institutions against
which the petitioners' sit-in was directed. Moreover, the
statements, unlike the ordinance in Peterson, did not
command restaurateurs to discriminate. A restaurateur
in New Orleans, unlike one in Greenville, could
integrate his services without violating any law.
Although there was evidence that the restaurateur's
actions were influenced by the official statements, the
Court did not rely on this factor. The Court held on the
basis of the statements alone that the degree of state
involvement in the private discriminatory denial of
service to the petitioners was sufficient to make that
denial state action violative of the Fourteenth
Amendment. As in Peterson, the Court's analysis of
state action did not turn on the actual enforcement of
the State's criminal law. Lombard, therefore, advances at
least two propositions. First, an authoritative expression
of state policy that is nondiscriminatory on its face may
be found to be discriminatory when considered against
the factual background of its promulgation. Cf. Guinn v.
United States, 238 U.S. 347, 364-365 (1915); Gomillion
v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960). Second, where a state
policy enforces privately chosen racial discrimination in
places of public accommodation, it renders such private
discrimination unconstitutional state action, regardless
of whether the private discriminator was motivated or
influenced by it.
The principles of Peterson and Lombard were extended
further in Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. 153 (1964).
That case also involved trespass convictions arising out
of a sit-in at a segregated restaurant. At the time, a
Florida regulation required restaurants to maintain
separate lavatory and toilet facilities for each race as well
as each sex. However, the regulation did not require
segregation of a restaurant itself; nor did the [398 U.S.
194] convictions of the demonstrators result from
anything they did with respect to the facilities that were
the subject of the regulation. Nevertheless, this Court
reversed the convictions on the ground that by virtue of
the regulation the State had become sufficiently
involved in the privately chosen segregation of the
restaurant to make that segregation state action. The
Court commented:
"While these Florida regulations do not directly and expressly
forbid restaurants to serve both white and colored people together,
they certainly embody a state policy putting burdens upon any
restaurant which serves both races, burdens bound to discourage
the serving of the two races together." 378 U. S., at 156.
Robinson involved neither a state command of
restaurant segregation, as in Peterson, nor a state policy
of enforcing restaurant segregation, as in Lombard. It
involved state imposition of burdens amounting to
discouragement of private integration. It is true that the
burden in that case happened to take the form of a
requirement of segregated lavatory facilities; but any
other burden—for example, a tax on integrated
restaurants —would have sufficed to render the privately
chosen restaurant segregation unconstitutional state
action. Again, the Court's finding of state action did not
depend on the use of the State's trespass law. Robinson
thus stands for the proposition that state
discouragement of a particular kind of privately chosen
integration renders that kind of privately chosen
segregation unconstitutional state action.
The step from Peterson, Lombard, and Robinson to the
present case is a small one. Indeed, it may be no step at
all, since those cases together hold that a state [398 U.S.
195] policy of discouraging privately chosen integration
or encouraging privately chosen segregation, even
though the policy is expressed in a form
nondiscriminatory on its face, is unconstitutional and
taints the privately chosen segregation it seeks to bring
about. These precedents suggest that the question of
state action in this case is whether, as petitioner
contends, Mississippi statutes do in fact manifest a state
policy of encouraging and supporting restaurant
segregation so that respondent's alleged privately chosen
segregation is unconstitutional state action.
To establish the existence in 1964 of a state statutory
policy to maintain segregation in restaurant facilities,
petitioner relies principally on Miss. Code Ann. §
2046.5 (1956), which, on its face, "authorizes" and
"empowers" owners of hotels, restaurants, and other
places of public accommodation and amusement to
refuse to serve whomsoever they choose.2 The decision
whether to serve a particular [398 U.S. 196] individual is
left to the unfettered discretion of the restaurant
management, which may refuse service for any reason
or for no reason. Thus, while there is no explicit
command in § 2046.5 that segregated eating facilities be
maintained, a refusal to serve on the basis of race alone
falls clearly within the broad terms of the statute. The
restaurateur is informed, in essence, that he may
discriminate for racial or any other reasons and that he
may call upon the police power of the State to make that
private decision effective through the trespass sanctions
expressly incorporated in § 2046.5. It is clear that, to the
extent that the statute authorizes and empowers
restaurateurs to discriminate on the basis of race, it
cannot pass muster under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, supra, at 726-
727 (STEWART, J., concurring).
Burton involved a statute that permitted a restaurateur
to refuse service to "persons whose reception or
entertainment by him would be offensive to the major
part of his customers . . . ." MR. JUSTICE STEWART
took the position that the state courts had "construed
this legislative enactment as authorizing discriminatory
classification based exclusively on color." 365 U. S., at
726-727. Justices Frankfurter, HARLAN, and
Whittaker, the only other Justices who dealt at length
with the statute,3 [398 U.S. 197] agreed that it would
violate the Fourteenth Amendment if so construed.
However, they thought the construction adopted by the
state courts insufficiently clear to make possible a final
determination of the issue.
The language of § 2046.5 is considerably broader than
that involved in Burton. Although § 2046.5 apparently
has not been authoritatively interpreted by the state
courts, its plain language clearly authorizes a
restaurateur to refuse service for any reason, which
obviously includes a refusal based upon race. Were there
any conceivable doubt that § 2046.5 was intended to
authorize, inter alia, "discriminatory classification based
exclusively on color," it is completely dispelled by a
consideration of the historical context in which § 2046.5
was enacted.
A legislative or constitutional provision need not be
considered in isolation, but may be examined "in terms
of its `immediate objective,' its `ultimate effect' and its
`historical context and the conditions existing prior to
its enactment.' " Reitman v. Mulkey, supra, at 373; cf.
Lombard v. Louisiana, supra. Through the 1950's and
1960's Mississippi had a "steel-hard, inflexible,
undeviating official policy of segregation." United States
v. City of Jackson, 318 F.2d 1, 5 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1963)
(Wisdom, J.). See generally J. Silver, Mississippi: The
Closed Society (1964). Section 2046.5 itself was
originally enacted in 1956 in the wake of our decisions
in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954);
349 U.S. 294 (1955). It was passed contemporaneously
with numerous statutes and resolutions condemning
Brown, 4 requiring racial segregation in various
transportation facilities,5 and committing the state
government to continued adherence to the principles of
racial [398 U.S. 198] segregation.6 Together with these
other statutes and resolutions, § 2046.5 is indexed in the
1956 Mississippi Session Laws under "Segregation" and
"Races."7 Prior [398 U.S. 199] to 1956, the State had
declared unlawful any conspiracy "[t]o overthrow or
violate the segregation laws of this state . . . ."8
Subsequent to the passage of § 2046.5, breach of the
peace, vagrancy, and trespass statutes similar to §
2046.59 were enacted or employed to give local officials
additional weapons to combat attempts to desegregate
places of public accommodation. See, e. g., Dilworth v.
Riner, 343 F.2d 226 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1965).10
Illustrative of the practical effect of these various
provisions is the incident that gave rise to this litigation.
[398 U.S. 200] Petitioner was arrested for vagrancy
shortly after she had unsuccessfully sought service at
respondent's store. In ordering dismissal of the charges
after removal of the prosecutions to the federal courts,
the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted "[t]he
utter baselessness of any conceivable contention that the
vagrancy statutes prohibited any conduct in which these
persons were engaged" and concluded that the arrests
had been made solely because petitioner had attempted
to receive service at a city library and at respondent's
store in the company of Negro friends. Achtenberg v.
Mississippi, 393 F.2d 468, 474-475 (C.A. 5th Cir.
1968).11
In sum, it may be said of the various statutes and
resolutions that constituted Mississippi's response to
Brown that "they are bound together as the parts of a
single plan. The plan may make the parts unlawful."
Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396 (1905)
(Holmes, J.). Section 2046.5 was an integral part of this
scheme to foster and encourage the practice of
segregation in places of public accommodation and
elsewhere, which it furthered by authorizing
discrimination and by affording those who elected to
discriminate on the basis of race a remedy under state
law. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any purpose for
the enactment of § 2046.5 other than to make clear the
authorization of private discrimination where such
express authorization did not exist previously. Cf.
Mulkey v. Reitman, 64 Cal.2d 529, 544, 413 P.2d 825,
835-836 (1966),[398 U.S. 201] aff'd, 387 U.S. 369 (1967).
Judge Waterman, dissenting in the Court of Appeals,
states that under the common law an innkeeper, and by
analogy a restaurateur, did not have the right to serve
only whomever he wished and to discriminate on the
basis of race in selecting his customers. 409 F.2d 121,
131-133. See Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 296-300
(1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring). Since the common
law is presumed to apply in Mississippi, Western Union
Telegraph Co. v. Goodman, 166 Miss. 782, 146 So. 128
(1933), Judge Waterman concludes that the State has
"drastically changed the common law" by enacting §
2046.5.12 409 F. 2d, at 132. Further support for this view
can be found in the preamble to § 2046.5 which states
that that provision "confer[s] upon any person . . . the
further right to refuse to sell or render a service to any
person . . . ." Miss. Laws 1956, c. 257. (Emphasis added.)
This formulation suggests that the legislature intended
to alter the existing state law.
It is not completely clear, however, that the common
law in regard to innkeepers and restaurateurs, as
understood by Judge Waterman, was ever widely
enforced in Mississippi in racial matters. In
Reconstruction times [398 U.S. 202] the State enacted a
civil rights law that forbade discrimination in places of
public accommodation and amusement. See Miss. Laws
1873, c. LXIII. It was upheld and applied in Donnell v.
State, 48 Miss. 661 (1873). That law, however, quickly
fell into desuetude.13 Thus some question exists as to
whether Mississippi "changed" the law as it existed in
that State in 1956. At least it can be said, however, that
Mississippi, by enacting § 2046.5, clarified the state law,
and in doing so elected to place the full authority of the
State behind private acts of discrimination. Since §
2046.5 authorizes discrimination on the basis of race, it
is invalid as applied to authorize such discrimination in
particular cases.
The remaining question concerning this aspect of the
present case is what nexus between § 2046.5 and
respondent's alleged discrimination petitioner must
show to establish that that discrimination is state action
violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our prior
decisions leave no doubt that the mere existence of
efforts by the State, through legislation or otherwise, to
authorize, encourage, or otherwise support racial
discrimination in a particular facet of life constitutes
illegal state involvement in those pertinent private acts
of discrimination that subsequently occur. See, e. g.,
Peterson v. City of Greenville, supra; Lombard v.
Louisiana, supra; Robinson v. Florida, [398 U.S. 203]
supra.14 This is so, as we noted in Reitman v. Mulkey,
supra, at 380, whether or not the private discriminator
was actually influenced in the commission of his act by
the policy of the State. Thus, when private action
conforms with state policy, it becomes a manifestation
of that policy and is thereby drawn within the ambit of
state action. In sum, if an individual discriminates on the
basis of race and does so in conformity with the State's
policy to authorize or encourage such discrimination,
neither the State nor the private party will be heard to
say that their mutual involvement is outside the
prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore,
in light of the statutory scheme including § 2046.5,
which authorized and encouraged restaurant
segregation, petitioner will fully satisfy the state-action
requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment if she
establishes that she was refused service on the basis of
race.
I turn now to the other elements of petitioner's case
under § 1983.
II
Title 42 U. S. C. § 1983 derives from § 1 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, entitled, "An Act to
enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States, and for other
Purposes."15 The 1871 Act, popularly known as the "Ku
[398 U.S. 204] Klux Klan Act," was, as its legislative
history makes absolutely clear, a response to the
outrages committed by the Klan in many parts of the
South. The conditions that gave rise to the Act were
discussed extensively in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167,
172-183 (1961). In the context of that case we pointed
out that although the 1871 Act was engendered by the
activities of the Klan, the language and purposes of §
1983 are not restricted to that evil. See 365 U. S., at 183.
See also [398 U.S. 205] United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S.
383, 388 (1915), where Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for
the Court, commented on § 6 of the Enforcement Act of
1870, 16 Stat. 141, as amended, now 18 U. S. C. § 241, in
words applicable to § 1983:
"Just as the Fourteenth Amendment . . . was adopted with a view to
the protection of the colored race but has been found to be equally
important in its application to the rights of all, [the statute] had a
general scope and used general words that have become the most
important now that the Ku Klux have passed away . . . . [W]e
cannot allow the past so far to affect the present as to deprive
citizens of the United States of the general protection which on its
face [the statute] most reasonably affords."
Stirred to action by the wholesale breakdown of
protection of civil rights in the South, Congress carried
to completion the creation of a comprehensive scheme
of remedies—civil, criminal, and military16 —for the
protection of constitutional rights from all major
interference.
In the 1871 Act, Congress undertook to provide broad
federal civil remedies against interference with the
exercise and actual enjoyment of constitutional rights,
particularly the right to equal protection. Section 1 (now
§ 1983) provided a civil remedy for deprivation of any
constitutional right by a person acting "under color of
any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage
of any State . . . ." Section 2 (now surviving [398 U.S.
206] in part as § 1985 (3)) provided a civil and a criminal
remedy against conspiratorial interference with any
person's enjoyment of equal protection. Section 6 (now
§ 1986) cast the net of civil liability even more widely by
providing a remedy against any person who, having the
ability by reasonable diligence to prevent a violation of §
2, fails to do so. These remedies were bolstered by other
criminal provisions of § 2 and by previously enacted
criminal laws. Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866,
14 Stat. 27, re-enacted as § 17 of the Enforcement Act of
1870, 16 Stat. 144, as amended, now 18 U. S. C. § 242,
provided a criminal remedy against what amounts to a
violation of § 1983. Section 6 of the Enforcement Act of
1870, 16 Stat. 141, as amended, now 18 U. S. C. § 241,
provided a criminal remedy against conspiracies to
interfere with the exercise or enjoyment of a federal
right.17
The history of this scheme of remedies for the
protection of civil rights was, until very recently, one of
virtual nullification by this Court. Key provisions were
declared unconstitutional or given an unduly narrow
construction wholly out of keeping with their
purposes.18 In United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629
(1883), the Court invalidated the criminal provision of §
2 of the [398 U.S. 207] Ku Klux Klan Act, the criminal
analogue to § 1985 (3), on the ground that Congress was
not authorized by § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to
prohibit interference by private persons with the
exercise of Fourteenth Amendment rights, except
perhaps in extreme and remote circumstances. Essential
to the holding was a recognition that the language of § 2
plainly reaches conspiracies not involving state officials.
See also Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U.S. 678 (1887). The
statute (Rev. Stat. § 5519) was repealed in 1909. 35 Stat.
1154. In Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651 (1951), the
Court, under the influence of Harris, construed § 1985
(3). Pointing out that the language of § 1985 (3) is
exactly the same (except for the remedy provided) as the
language of the statute condemned in Harris, the Court
thought it necessary to read in a limitation of the section
to conspiracies involving state action, in order to sustain
its constitutionality. This limiting construction
necessarily carried over to § 1986, whose scope is keyed
to that of § 1985.
Section 241 of 18 U. S. C. fared little better. That statute,
as indicated, deals generally with conspiracies to
interfere with the exercise of federal rights. It was
established soon after its enactment that § 241 reaches
conspiracies among private persons to interfere with
"rights which arise from the relationship of the
individual and the Federal Government." United States
v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70, 77 (1951) (opinion of
Frankfurter, J.). See, e. g., Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S.
651 (1884); United States v. Waddell, 112 U.S. 76
(1884); Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263 (1892); In
re Quarles, 158 U.S. 532 (1895). However, the concept
of "arising from" was given a very narrow construction
in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876).
Moreover, in United States v. Williams, supra, the
Court divided 4 to 4 on the question whether § 241
reaches private conspiracies to [398 U.S. 208] interfere
with the exercise of Fourteenth Amendment rights,
which arise from the relation of an individual and a
State. The four members of the Court who thought §
241 does not protect the exercise of Fourteenth
Amendment rights placed considerable reliance on the
argument that § 241 would be unconstitutional if
construed otherwise. See 341 U. S., at 77-78. See also
Hodges v. United States, 203 U.S. 1 (1906).
Although the other principal criminal statute protecting
civil rights, 18 U. S. C. § 242, the criminal analogue to §
1983, was construed to protect Fourteenth Amendment
rights, it was nonetheless held constitutional. However,
under this statute a violation can be found only if the
defendant acted "willfully," that is, with "a specific intent
to deprive a person of a federal right made definite by
decision or other rule of law." See Screws v. United
States, 325 U.S. 91, 103 (1945). Moreover, this Court
has never had occasion to consider whether § 242
reaches wholly nonofficial conduct.
Thus, until very recently, the construction of the
surviving remedial civil rights statutes was narrowed or
placed in doubt by a restrictive view of the power of
Congress under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But
that view of congressional power has now been
completely rejected by this Court.
In United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966), and
United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 (1966), the Court
expressly held that § 241 does protect Fourteenth
Amendment rights, thereby squarely resolving the issue
that divided the court in Williams. Because the
conspiracy in Guest was alleged to have been carried out
by private persons acting in conjunction with state
officials,19 the Court found it unnecessary to consider
whether § 241 [398 U.S. 209] would be constitutional if
construed to reach wholly private conspiracies to
interfere with the exercise of Fourteenth Amendment
rights. However, to put the point beyond doubt, six
members of the Court in Guest expressly stated their
view that Congress has power under § 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment to protect Fourteenth
Amendment rights against interference by private
persons, without regard to state involvement in the
private interference. See United States v. Guest, supra,
at 761-762 (opinion of Clark, J., joined by BLACK and
Fortas, JJ.), 774-786 (opinion of BRENNAN, J., joined
by Warren, C. J., and DOUGLAS, J.). This general view
of congressional power under § 5 was expressly adopted
by the Court in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641
(1966), where we said:
"By including § 5 the draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a
specific provision applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment, the
same broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause,
Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. . . . Correctly viewed, § 5 is a positive grant of
legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in
determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the
guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment." 384 U. S., at 650-651.
See also South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301
(1966).20
Thus the holding of Harris and the Civil Rights Cases,
109 U.S. 3 (1883), that Congress cannot under § 5
protect the exercise of Fourteenth Amendment rights
from private interference has been overruled. See
United States v. Guest, supra, at 782-783 (opinion of
BRENNAN, [398 U.S. 210] J.). Consequently, the
interpretation of the civil rights statutes need no longer
be warped by unwarranted concern that Congress lacks
power under § 5 to reach conduct by persons other than
public officials. There is no doubt that § 1983 protects
Fourteenth Amendment rights. See Monroe v. Pape,
supra, at 170-171; id., at 205-206 (opinion of
Frankfurter, J.). Accordingly, the only substantial
question in this branch of the present case is whether §
1983 was intended by Congress to reach nonofficial
conduct of the kind at issue here.
Petitioner contends that respondent's discrimination
against her was within the scope of § 1983 on either of
two grounds. First, she claims that respondent acted
under color of Mississippi statutory law, and in
particular Mississippi Code § 2046.5. Second, she claims
that respondent acted under color of a custom or usage
of Mississippi, which prescribed segregation of the races
in dining facilities.
Petitioner's claim that respondent acted under color of
Mississippi statutory law is similar to her claim that
respondent's action constituted state action. Indeed, the
two claims would be proved by the same factual
showing if respondent were a state official who acted by
virtue of his official capacity or a private party acting in
conjunction with such state official, for when a state
official acts by virtue of his official capacity it is precisely
the use or misuse of state authority that makes the
action state action. However, when a private party acts
alone,21 more must be shown, in my view, to establish
that he acts "under color of" a state statute or other
authority than is needed to show that his action
constitutes state action.
[398 U.S. 211] As I pointed out in Part I, supra, under the
constitutional principle that no State shall have any
significant involvement whatever in racial
discrimination, and under our prior cases, the mere
existence of a state policy authorizing, encouraging, or
otherwise supporting racial discrimination in a
particular kind of service is sufficient to render private
discrimination in that service state action. However, the
statutory term "under color of any statute" has a
narrower meaning than the constitutional concept of
"state action." The "under color" language of § 1983
serves generally to limit the kinds of constitutional
violation for which the section provides a remedy. To
understand how that language applies to private
persons, it is helpful to consider its application to state
officials. In other legal usage, the word "color," as in
"color of authority," "color of law," "color of office,"
"color of title," and "colorable," suggests a kind of
holding out and means "appearance, semblance, or
simulacrum, " but not necessarily the reality. See H.
Black, Law Dictionary 331-332 (rev. 4th ed. 1968).
However, as the word appears in § 1983, it covers both
actions actually authorized by a State, see Myers v.
Anderson, 238 U.S. 368 (1915); Nixon v. Herndon, 273
U.S. 536 (1927); Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 (1939),
and misuse of state authority in ways not intended by
the State, see, e. g., Monroe v. Pape, supra; Screws v.
United States, supra, at 111. In some of these latter
situations there is a holding out in that the official uses
his actual authority to give the appearance that he has
authority to take the particular action he is taking. In
other cases the abuse of power is so palpable that the
victim or any observer may well be aware that the
official is exceeding his authority, so that any holding
out of authority would be wholly transparent. In these
cases the misuse of authority alone is enough to warrant
recovery. See, e. g., Monroe v. Pape, supra; [398 U.S.
212] United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326 (1941);
Catlette v. United States, 132 F.2d 902 (C. A. 4th Cir.
1943). Thus, a public official acting by virtue of his
official capacity always acts under color of a state statute
or other law, whether or not he overtly relies on that
authority to support his action, and whether or not that
action violates state law. A private person acts "under
color of" a state statute or other law when he, like the
official, in some way acts consciously pursuant to some
law that gives him aid, comfort, or incentive, cf. Griffin
v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 130 (1964); Flemming v. South
Carolina Elec. & Gas Co., 224 F.2d 752 (C. A. 4th Cir.
1955), appeal dismissed, 351 U.S. 901 (1956); or when
he acts in conjunction with a state official, as in United
States v. Price, supra. In the present case Mississippi
statutory law did authorize and encourage respondent to
discriminate against petitioner on the basis of race.
Therefore petitioner can establish that respondent acted
"under color of" Mississippi statutory law by showing
that respondent was aware of that body of law as
prescribing, encouraging, authorizing, legitimating,
effectuating, or otherwise supporting its refusal to serve
petitioner. The vice of action under color of statute
exists wherever the private discriminator consciously
draws from a state statute any kind of support for his
discrimination. Therefore, it is irrelevant that petitioner
was not arrested under the trespass provision of §
2046.5.
Petitioner's second contention, that respondent
discriminated againt her "under color of [a] custom, or
usage" of Mississippi, presents more difficulty. I have
found few prior cases construing the phrase "under
color of custom, or usage" in the context of § 1983;22
and it [398 U.S. 213] has not been litigated under 18 U. S.
C. § 242, though in that context it was briefly discussed
in the opinions in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra. It
is true that on occasion this Court has summed up the
statutory language "under color of any statute,
ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or
Territory" as meaning "under color of law," and as
incorporating a requirement of state action akin to that
of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., United States
v. Price, supra, at 794 n. 7. But the loose and vague
phrase "under color of law" has always been used by the
Court in the context of cases in which reliance was put
on something other than "custom or usage." The Court
[398 U.S. 214] has never held, or even intimated, that
"custom or usage" means "law." Indeed, MR. JUSTICE
HARLAN, dissenting in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,
supra, used a different formula in summarizing the
"under color of" language in § 242; he said it referred to
"action taken pursuant to state or community
authority." 392 U. S., at 454. Moreover, he referred to
"discriminations which were legitimated by a state or
community sanction sufficiently powerful to deserve the
name `custom.' " Id., at 457. (Emphasis added.) See also
Monroe v. Pape, supra, at 193 (HARLAN, J.,
concurring) ("abuses so recurrent as to amount to
`custom, or usage' "). Thus, "under color of law" has not
been the only formula used by members of this Court to
summarize the parallel language in §§ 242 and 1983.23 It
is also true that the phrase "under color [398 U.S. 215] of
law" occurs in the debates on the 1871 Act, see n. 25,
infra. But since in the original version of § 1983, as
introduced and enacted, the word "law" was the first
word in the enumeration following "color of,"24 the use
of "under color of law" as a handy formula in debate is
readily explained. More importantly, the phrase has
never been taken to be a considered, comprehensive,
and authoritative summation of the provisions of §
1983. As this Court said over a century ago and has since
repeated, "In expounding a statute, we must not be
guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but
look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object
and policy." United States v. Boisdoré's Heirs, 8 How.
113, 122 (1849) (Taney, C. J.); Mastro Plastics Corp. v.
NLRB, 350 U.S. 270, 285 (1956); Richards v. United
States, 369 U.S. 1, 11 (1962); Dandridge v. Williams,
397 U.S. 471, 517 (1970) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).
The legislative history of § 1983 provides no direct
guidance for the interpretation of the phrase "custom or
usage." Much of the lengthy debate concerned the truth
of the allegations of KKK outrages and the
constitutionality and wisdom of other sections of the
Act. Little attention was given to the precise wording of
§ 1983, and there was no sustained discussion of the
meaning of "custom or usage."25 Consequently, in my
[398 U.S. 216] view, we are called on to analyze the
purposes Congress sought to achieve by enacting § 1983
in the context of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. Only by
relating the [398 U.S. 217] phrase "custom or usage" to
congressional purposes can we properly interpret and
apply the statutory language today.
In seeking to determine the purposes of § 1983, it is
important to recall that it originated as part of a statute
directed against the depredations of a private army.
Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 339 (remarks of Rep.
Kelley, a supporter of the bill). The Klan was recognized
by Congress to be a widespread conspiracy "operating
wholly outside the law," Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,
supra, at 436, and employing a variety of methods to
coerce Negroes and others to forgo exercise of civil
rights theoretically protected by the Constitution and
federal statutes. In some areas of the South the Klan was
strong enough to paralyze the operations of state
government. As Representative Coburn, a supporter of
the bill, noted:
"Such, then, is the character of these outrages— numerous,
repeated, continued from month to month and year to year,
extending over many States; all similar in their character, aimed at a
similar class of citizens; all palliated or excused or [398 U.S. 218]
justified or absolutely denied by the same class of men. Not like the
local outbreaks sometimes appearing in particular districts, where a
mob or a band of regulators may for a time commit crimes and defy
the law, but having every mark and attribute of a systematic,
persistent, well-defined organization, with a fixed purpose, with a
regular plan of action.
"The development of this condition of affairs was not the work of a
day or even of a year. It could not be, in the nature of things; it must
be slow; one fact to be piled on another, week after week, year after
year. . . .
"Such occurrences show that there is a pre-concerted and effective
plan by which thousands of men are deprived of the equal
protection of the laws. The arresting power is fettered, the
witnesses are silenced, the courts are impotent, the laws are
annulled, the criminal goes free, the persecuted citizen looks in vain
for redress. This condition of affairs extends to counties and States;
it is, in many places, the rule, and not the exception." Cong. Globe,
42d Cong., 1st Sess., 458-459.
See also id., at App. 172 (remarks of Sen. Pool, a
supporter); id., at 653 (remarks of Sen. Osborn, a
supporter); id., at 155-160 (remarks of Sen. Sherman, a
supporter). Thus the mischief that the legislation of
1871 was intended to remedy derived, not from state
action, but from concerted "private" action that the
States were unwilling or unable to cope with.
Senator Schurz, a moderate opponent who on behalf of
the President had personally investigated the disorders
in the South, summed up the condition to be dealt with:
"The real evil in the southern States you will find in the baffled proslavery
tendency prevailing there; [398 U.S. 219] in a diseased public
sentiment which partly vents itself in violent acts, partly winks at
them, and partly permits itself to be overawed by them. That public
sentiment is not only terrorizing timid people, but it is corrupting
the jury-box, it is overawing the witness-stand, and it is thus
obstructing the functions of justice." Id., at 687.
Representative [later President] Garfield, a moderate
supporter, focused more specifically on one of the
principal evils § 1983 was designed to remedy:
"[T]he chief complaint is not that the laws of the State are unequal,
but that even where the laws are just and equal on their face, yet, by
a systematic maladministration of them, or a neglect or refusal to
enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal
protection under them." Id., at App. 153.
Accordingly, in his view, § 1983 was intended to
provide a remedy in federal court for, inter alia, certain
denials of equal protection that occurred even in States
with just and equal laws when some private persons
acted against others and the State failed to provide
protection. Thus, both the House and the Senate were
quite aware that the task before them was to devise a
scheme of remedies against privately instigated
interference with the exercise of constitutional rights,
through terror, force of numbers, concerted action, and
other means.
The debates in both Houses also make it clear that many
of those who gave the most careful attention to the
conditions that called for the bill, to the provisions of
the bill itself, and to the problems of constitutionality
and policy it presented, did not think that in § 1983 the
Federal Government undertook to provide a federal
remedy for every isolated act by private persons that
[398 U.S. 220] amounted to interference with the
exercise of a constitutional right. See, e. g., id., at 578-
579 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull, an opponent); id., at 514
(remarks of Rep. Poland, a supporter and conferee); id.,
at App. 153 (remarks of Rep. Garfield); id., at App. 79
(remarks of Rep. A. Perry, a supporter).26 Where, for
example, the injury to federal rights was the result of a
genuinely individual act of private prejudice, then it
could not be said that the state and local authorities were
failing to give equal protection by countenancing major
interference with the exercise of federal rights. Indeed,
in most instances it could rightly be said that the acts of
discrimination were isolated precisely because the State
was affirmatively fulfilling its obligation to afford equal
protection. In such circumstances no useful purpose
would be served by providing a federal remedy for the
isolated wrong, and the resulting federal intrusion into
state affairs would be unjustified.
Near the conclusion of the debate, Rep. Garfield
observed:
"I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we have at last secured a bill, trenchant
in its provisions, that reaches down into the very heart of the Ku
Klux organization, and yet is so guarded as to preserve intact the
autonomy of the States, the machinery of the State governments,
and the municipal organizations established under State laws." Id.,
at 808.
This statute, "trenchant" but measured, provided a
scheme of three civil remedies, currently codified in §§
1983, 1985, and 1986. In view of the purposes these
remedies were designed to achieve, § 1983 would be
read too narrowly if it were restricted to acts of state
officials and those acting in concert with them.
Congress did not say, "Every state official and others
acting [398 U.S. 221] in concert with him . . ."; Congress
said, "[A]ny [now Every] person who, under color . . ."
(emphasis added). Similarly, it would be read too
broadly if interpreted to reach acts of purely individual
discrimination. As I read § 1983 together with the other
sections, against the background of the congressional
debates, I understand them to protect the exercise of
constitutional rights by reaching three kinds of
interference that are sufficiently "major" in their effects
to have warranted congressional action.
The first category is that involving action under color of
authority derived from state government and this
category of invasions is clearly within § 1983. Where
state officials or private persons acting consciously with
state support participate in the interference with the
exercise of federal rights, the interference assumes a far
graver cast than it otherwise would have, and the
authority of the State is brought into conflict with the
authority of the Constitution. See, e. g., Monroe v. Pape,
supra, at 238 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).
The second category is that involving conspiracy, which
is within the ambit of § 1985. It is well recognized in the
criminal law that conspiratorial agreements for
concerted action present aggravated dangers to society,
see United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 88 (1915);
Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 644 (1946);
Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 448-449
(1949) (Jackson, J., concurring); Note, Developments in
the Law—Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 920,
923-924 (1959), and for this general reason, as
exemplified in the activities of the Ku Klux Klan,
Congress provided for a civil remedy against
conspiratorial interference with the right to equal
protection.27
[398 U.S. 222] The third category is that where, in the
absence of the overt elements of a conspiracy,
constitutional rights are violated by widespread habitual
practices or conventions regarded as prescribing norms
for conduct, and supported by common consent, or
official or unofficial community sanctions—in short,
customs and usages. Where violation of constitutional
rights is customary, the violation is, by definition,
widespread and enduring, and therefore worthy of
congressional response. As I read § 1983, that response
was made in the provision of a remedy against.
"[e]very person who, under color of any . . . custom, or usage, of
any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the
United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the
Constitution . . . ."28
The excerpts from the congressional debate that I have
quoted make clear that Congress wanted a civil remedy,
not only against conspiratorial violence, but also against
the perhaps more subtle but potentially more virulent
customary infringements of constitutional rights. The
Ku Klux Klan was an extreme reflection of broadly held
attitudes toward Negroes and longstanding practices of
denying them rights that the Constitution secured for all
people. The fundamental evil was a "diseased public
sentiment" reflected in multifarious efforts to confine
Negroes in their former status of inferiority.
Accordingly, a statute designed to reach "down into the
very heart of the Ku Klux organization" had to deal with
the widespread manifestations of that diseased public
[398 U.S. 223] sentiment. Respect for constitutional
rights was to be "embodied not only in the laws, but
intrenched in the daily habits of the American people . . .
." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 339 (remarks of
Rep. Kelley). Congress could not legislate popular
sentiments, but in providing generally in the Ku Klux
Klan Act for the protection of constitutional rights
against major types of interference it could, and I think
it did in § 1983, provide a remedy against violations that
in particular States were so common as to be customary.
As this Court recently said in construing another of the
early civil rights statutes, "We think that history leaves
no doubt that, if we are to give [the statute] the scope
that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as
broad as its language." United States v. Price, supra, at
801. The language of § 1983 imposes no obstacle to an
interpretation carrying out the congressional purposes I
have identified. I think it clearly possible for a private
person or entity like respondent to "subject" a person or
"[cause him] to be subjected . . . to the deprivation" of a
constitutional right, as those quoted words are used in §
1983. In Monroe v. Pape, supra, we held that a cause of
action was stated under § 1983 by an allegation that
police officers invaded petitioners' home in violation of
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Certainly if
"deprivation" in § 1983 means something like
"extinguishment," then no cause of action could have
been stated, for no policeman, nor even any state
government as a whole, can extinguish a constitutional
right, at least not while this Court sits. Cf. Panhandle Oil
Co., v. Knox, 277 U.S. 218, 223 (Holmes, J.,
dissenting).29 A constitutional [398 U.S. 224] right can
be extinguished only by amendment of the Constitution
itself. If "deprivation" meant "extinguishment," §
1983—and also 18 U. S. C. § 242—would be a nullity.
Thus all the cases finding violations of these sections
must be taken to have held that "deprivation" as used in
these statutes means, not "extinguishment," but rather
something like "violation," "denial," or "infringement."
Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at 420-421;
Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 605 (remarks of Sen.
Trumbull, manager of 1866 Civil Rights bill, on § 242).
As the present case illustrates, it is possible for private
action in some circumstances to constitute state action
violating a constitutional right, and such action amounts
to "deprivation" within the meaning of § 1983.
In discussing petitioner's contention that respondent
acted under color of state law I have already indicated
my understanding of the words "under color of." See
supra, at 211-212. I would apply that understanding
here as well. I read "custom, or usage" in § 1983 to mean
what it has usually meant at common law—a widespread
and longstanding practice, commonly regarded as
prescribing norms for conduct, and backed by sanctions.
[398 U.S. 225] See, e. g., Strother v. Lucas, 12 Pet. 410,
437, 445-446 (1838); United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet.
691, 713-714 (1832). The sanctions need not be imposed
by the State. A custom can have the effect or force of law
even where it is not backed by the force of the State. See,
e. g., Adams v. Otterback, 15 How. 539, 545 (1854);
Merchants' Bank v. State Bank, 10 Wall. 604, 651
(1871); cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at 423.30
The power of custom to generate and impose rules of
conduct, even without the support of the State, has long
been recognized. See, e. g., Mercer County v. Hacket, 1
Wall. 83, 95 (1864); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*64; B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 58-
64 (1921).31
[398 U.S. 226] Of course, a custom or usage is within §
1983 only if it is a custom of a "State or Territory." It
was recognized during the debate on the Ku Klux Klan
Act that the word "State" does not refer only to state
government. In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 720-721
(1869),32 decided just two years before the debate, this
Court said of the word "State" as used in the
Constitution:
"It describes sometimes a people or community of individuals
united more or less closely in political relations, inhabiting
temporarily or permanently the same country; often it denotes only
the country or territorial region, inhabited by such a community;
not unfrequently it is applied to the government under which the
people live; at other times it represents the combined idea of
people, territory, and government.
"It is not difficult to see that in all these senses the primary
conception is that of a people or community. The people, in
whatever territory dwelling, either temporarily or permanently,
and whether organized under a regular government, or united by
looser and less definite relations, constitute the state.
"This is undoubtedly the fundamental idea upon which the
republican institutions of our own country are established. . . .
"In the Constitution the term state most frequently expresses the
combined idea just noticed, of people, territory, and government. A
state, in the ordinary sense of the Constitution, is a political
community of free citizens, occupying a territory of defined
boundaries, and organized under a [398 U.S. 227] government
sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and established by
the consent of the governed."
This language was quoted in the debate. See Cong.
Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 80 (remarks of Rep. A.
Perry). When the word "State" in § 1983 is so
understood, then it is not at all strained or tortured—
indeed, it is perfectly natural—to read "custom" as
meaning simply "custom" in the enumeration "statute,
ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State."
Moreover, I agree with the Court that just as an
ordinance can be state action, so, too, can a custom of a
subdivision of a State be a custom "of [a] State" for
purposes of § 1983; and in my view a custom of the
people living in a subdivision is a custom of the
subdivision. Thus a person acts under color of a custom
or usage of a State when there is among the people of a
State or subdivision of a State a widespread and
longstanding practice regarded as prescribing norms for
conduct and supported by community sentiment or
sanctions, and a person acts in accordance with this
custom either from a belief that the norms it prescribes
authorize or require his conduct or from a belief that the
community at large regards it as authorizing or
requiring his conduct.33
[398 U.S. 228] The Court eschews any attempt to
interpret § 1983 against the background of a rational
scheme of congressional purposes. Instead it relies
basically on three sets of materials to support its
restrictive interpretation of the statute. First are cases;
some make casual use of the vague phrase "under color
of law" as a summation of the "under color" language of
§ 1983, and the rest interpret the significance of custom
either under an erroneous theory of constitutional law
or outside the specific context of § 1983 altogether. I
have already shown why these cases are hardly relevant,
much less controlling, here. See supra, at 213-214 and n.
22. The Court's second set of authorities consists of
three quotations from the legislative history purporting
to explain the scope of § 1983. I have already shown that
such quotations cannot be set up as a reliable guide to
interpretation. See n. 25, supra. Given the demonstrable
lack of consensus among the debaters on this precise
issue, it is highly misleading to select two or three
statements arguably favorable to one view and
pronounce them authoritative. Moreover, as I have
already indicated, see n. 25, supra, the remarks of
Representative Shellabarger and Senator Edmunds
consist merely of a handy formula for a debate not
directed to matters of draftsmanship, and are themselves
subject to varying interpretation.
Finally, the Court dwells on the relative lack of
controversy over § 1983 in contrast to the heated debate
over § 2 of the 1871 Act. However, despite Senator
Edmunds' complacent prediction, § 1983 was opposed,
and opposed vigorously. Senator Johnston commented,
"The Senator from Vermont [Senator Edmunds] said
that there would be no objection to the first section of
the bill. That section, in my view, has only the slight
objection of being unconstitutional." Cong. Globe, 42d
Cong., 1st Sess., App. 215. Representative [398 U.S. 229]
McHenry called § 1983 an "outrage," a "flagrant
infraction" of the Constitution. Id., at 429.
Representative Edward Rice characterized it as bringing
"lambs to the slaughter"; it was, he said, "a provision for
dragging persons from their homes, from their
neighbors, and from the vicinage of the witnesses for
the redress of private grievances to the Federal courts."
Id., at 395. See also id., at App. 216-217 (remarks of Sen.
Thurman).
Moreover, the Court does not adequately characterize
the controversy over § 2 of the Act. As originally
proposed, § 2 would have made a federal crime of any
conspiracy in a State to commit an act that if committed
on a federal enclave would constitute "murder,
manslaughter, mayhem, robbery, assault and battery,
perjury, subornation of perjury, criminal obstruction of
legal process or resistance of officers in discharge of
official duty, arson, or larceny." See id., at App. 68-69
(remarks of Rep. Shellabarger). Extreme opponents of
the bill attacked this section, as they attacked other
sections. Moderate opponents objected not because the
section reached private conduct but because it ousted
the States from a broad range of their criminal
jurisdiction even where they were successfully meeting
their constitutional obligation to provide equal
protection. See, e. g., id., at 366 (remarks of Rep. Arthur,
an opponent). Representative Garfield, for example,
criticized the original § 2, see id., at App. 153, but
praised and voted for the final bill, including § 2, which
he understood to reach private conduct, see id., at 807,
808.
On its intrinsic merits, the Court's conclusion that
custom "for purposes of § 1983 must have the force of
law" would be wholly acceptable if the phrase "force of
law" meant, as at common law, merely that custom must
have the effect of law—that it be generally regarded as
having normative force, whether or not enforced [398
U.S. 230] or otherwise supported by government. It is
clear, however, that this is not the Court's meaning. The
Court takes the position that custom can acquire the
force of law only "by virtue of the persistent practices of
state officials." Little in the debate supports this narrow
reading of the statute. The statement by Representative
Garfield on which the Court relies, ante, at 167, refers
not merely to "permanent and well-settled" official
practices, but more broadly to "systematic maladministration
of [the laws], or a neglect or refusal to
enforce" them. In short, under Representative Garfield's
theory of the Equal Protection Clause, private
customary violations of constitutional rights on the
basis of race were denials of equal protection because of
the failure of the State to prevent or remedy them. Mere
state inaction converted customary private
discrimination into a denial of equal protection, which
Congress under §§ 1 and 5 had power to remedy. See
also Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 333-334
(remarks of Rep. Hoar, a moderate supporter); id., at
375 (remarks of Rep. Lowe, a supporter). Our cases have
never explicitly held that state inaction alone in the face
of purely private discrimination constitutes a denial of
equal protection. But cf. Burton v. Wilmington Parking
Authority, supra, at 725; Catlette v. United States, 132
F.2d 902, 907 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1943); Lynch v. United
States, 189 F.2d 476 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1951); Henkin,
Shelley v. Kraemer: Notes for a Revised Opinion, 110 U.
Pa. L. Rev. 473 (1962); see also supra, at 189.
Nevertheless, the constitutional theory of the men who
enacted § 1983 remains relevant for our interpretation
of its meaning. Representative Garfield's theory of § 1 of
the Fourteenth Amendment and of congressional power
under §§ 1 and 5 had strong support in the debate. See
Harris, supra, n. 26. Recognition of that theory—and a
fortiori of the other principal theory among the bill's
supporters, the [398 U.S. 231] radical view that the
Fourteenth Amendment empowers Congress to assert
plenary jurisdiction over state affairs, see ibid.—only
provides further confirmation for the conclusion that
"custom" in § 1983 means custom of the people of a
State, not custom of state officials.
III
Since this case is being remanded, I think it proper to
express my views on the kinds of relief to which
petitioner may be entitled if she should prevail on the
merits.
Section 1983 in effect authorizes the federal courts to
protect rights "secured by the Constitution and laws" by
invoking any of the remedies known to the arsenal of
the law. Standards governing the granting of relief
under § 1983 are to be developed by the federal courts in
accordance with the purposes of the statute and as a
matter of federal common law. See Tenney v.
Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367 (1951); Monroe v. Pape, supra;
Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967); Basista v. Weir, 340
F.2d 74, 85-87 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1965); cf. Sullivan v. Little
Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 238-240 (1969); J. I. Case
Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433-434 (1964). Of course,
where justice requires it, federal district courts are dutybound
to enrich the jurisprudence of § 1983 by looking
to the remedies provided by the States wherein they sit.
42 U. S. C. § 1988. But resort to state law as such should
be had only in cases where for some reason federal
remedial law is not and cannot be made adequate to
carry out the purposes of the statute.
Section 1983 does not in general impose strict liability
on all who come within its prohibitions; certain broad
immunities are recognized. See Tenney v. Brandhove,
supra; Monroe v. Pape, supra, at 187-192; Pierson v.
Ray, supra, at 553-555. In some types of cases where the
wrong under § 1983 is closely analogous to a wrong
[398 U.S. 232] recognized in the law of torts, it is
appropriate for the federal court to apply the relevant
tort doctrines as to the bearing of particular mental
elements on the existence and amount of liability. See, e.
g., Pierson v. Ray, supra; Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781
(C. A. 5th Cir. 1969). In other types of cases, however,
the common law of torts may be divided on important
questions of defenses and relief, or it may be inadequate
to carry out the purposes of the statute. Thus the
common law is not an infallible guide for the
development of § 1983. In particular, denial of equal
protection on the basis of race was the central evil that §
1983 was designed to stamp out. Where that is the basis
for recovery, relief should not depend on the vagaries of
the general common law but should be governed by
uniform and effective federal standards.
The appropriateness of any particular remedy in a given
case depends on the circumstances of that case, and
especially on the degree of culpability of the defendant.
In my view, where a plaintiff shows a voluntary denial
of equal protection on the ground of race amounting to
a violation of § 1983 he is entitled to recover
compensation for actual damages, if any, simply on the
basis of the proved violation. The question of
compensatory damages is one of allocation of actual loss,
and, as between the innocent plaintiff and the defendant
who deliberately discriminates on the basis of race, I
think it just and faithful to the statutory purposes to
impose the loss on the discriminator, even if he was
unaware that his discrimination constituted state action
denying equal protection. Proof of an evil motive or of a
specific intent to deprive a person of a constitutional
right is generally not required under § 1983. Monroe v.
Pape, supra, at 183-187; Whirl v. Kern, supra. And,
indeed, in Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536 (1927), and
Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 (1939), this Court upheld
complaints seeking [398 U.S. 233] $5,000 recoveries
from state election officials who merely carried out their
official duty to prevent the plaintiffs from voting under
discriminatory state statutes which made them ineligible
to vote. Of course, there may be cases where it would be
proper to give declaratory or injunctive relief without
damages. See Williams v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 110 U. S.
App. D. C. 358, 370, 293 F.2d 835, 847 (1961) (Bazelon,
J., dissenting).
To recover punitive damages, I believe a plaintiff must
show more than a bare violation of § 1983. On the other
hand, he need not show that the defendant specifically
intended to deprive him of a recognized federal right, as
is required by the word "willfully" in 18 U. S. C. § 242,
see Screws v. United States, supra. Nor need he show
actual damages. Basista v. Weir, supra, at 87-88; Tracy
v. Robbins, 40 F. R. D. 108, 113 (D. C. S. C. 1966). It is
sufficient for the plaintiff to show either that the
defendant acted "under color of [a] statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory,"
with actual knowledge that he was violating a right
"secured by the Constitution and laws," or that the
defendant acted with reckless disregard of whether he
was thus violating such a right. Cf. C. McCormick,
Handbook on the Law of Damages § 79 (1935).
However, in my view, a proprietor of a place of public
accommodation who discriminates on the basis of race
after our decision in Peterson v. City of Greenville,
supra, and the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U. S. C. §§ 2000a to 2000h-6, does so with
reckless disregard as a matter of law, and therefore may
be found liable for punitive damages.34 Of course, it is
proper for the factfinder to consider the degree of
recklessness or actual knowledge and other
circumstances in assessing the amount of punitive
damages to award in a particular case.
[398 U.S. 234] It may be argued that it is inequitable to
impose punitive damages on a defendant, a restaurateur
for example, who knowingly or recklessly violates a
constitutional right and § 1983 out of fear that he will
lose some of his customers if he does not. That
argument is plainly unacceptable. The protection of
constitutional rights may not be watered down because
some members of the public actively oppose the exercise
of constitutional rights by others. Cooper v. Aaron, 358
U.S. 1 (1958). To give any weight at all to that argument
would be to encourage popular opposition to
compliance with the Constitution. Moreover, the
argument is particularly devoid of merit in the context
of § 1983, which was enacted by a Congress determined
to stamp out widespread violations of constitutional
rights at virtually any cost, and which imposed liability
even on persons who simply failed to prevent certain
violations. See Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., 804
(remarks of Rep. Poland). If § 1983 is given an
interpretation befitting its purposes, the threat of
withdrawal of patronage will be largely empty since no
other place of public accommodation in the community
will be in a better position to discriminate. The prospect
of substantial punitive damages may be the most
effective means to persuade all proprietors of places of
public accommodation to respect constitutional rights.
