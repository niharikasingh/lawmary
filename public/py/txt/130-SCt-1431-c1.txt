The New York law at issue, N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann.
(CPLR) § 901(b) (West 2006), is a procedural rule that is
not part of New York's substantive law. Accordingly, I
agree with Justice SCALIA that Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 23 must apply in this case and join Parts I and
II-A of the Court's opinion. But I also agree with Justice
GINSBURG that there are some state procedural rules
that federal courts must apply in diversity cases because
they function as a part of the State's definition of
substantive rights and remedies.
I
It is a long-recognized principle that federal courts
sitting in diversity "apply state substantive law and
federal procedural law." Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460,
465, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).1 This principle
is governed by a statutory framework, and the way that
it is administered varies depending upon whether there
is a federal rule addressed to the matter. See id. at 469-
472, 85 S.Ct. 1136. If no federal rule applies, a federal
court must follow the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. §
1652, and make the "relatively unguided Erie choice,"2
Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136, to determine
whether the state law is the "rule of decision." But when
a situation is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of
Decision Act inquiry by its own terms does not apply.
See § 1652; Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
Instead, the Rules Enabling Act (Enabling Act) controls.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2072.
That does not mean, however, that the federal rule
always governs. Congress has provided for a system of
uniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal
courts sitting in diversity operate as "an independent
system for administering justice to litigants who
properly invoke its jurisdiction," Byrd v. Blue Ridge
Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 537, 78 S.Ct.
893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958), and not [130 S.Ct. 1449] as
state-court clones that assume all aspects of state
tribunals but are managed by Article III judges. See
Hanna, 380 U.S. at 473-474, 85 S.Ct. 1136. But while
Congress may have the constitutional power to
prescribe procedural rules that interfere with state
substantive law in any number of respects, that is not
what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in the
Enabling Act that although "[t]he Supreme Court" may
"prescribe general rules of practice and procedure," §
2072(a), those rules "shall not abridge, enlarge or modify
any substantive right," § 2072(b). Therefore, "[w]hen a
situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,. . . the
court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule"
unless doing so would violate the Act or the
Constitution. Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
Although the Enabling Act and the Rules of Decision
Act "say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state
`substantive' law and federal `procedural' law," the
inquiries are not the same. Ibid.; see also id. at 469-470,
85 S.Ct. 1136. The Enabling Act does not invite federal
courts to engage in the "relatively unguided Erie choice,"
id. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136, but instead instructs only that
federal rules cannot "abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right," § 2072(b). The Enabling Act's
limitation does not mean that federal rules cannot
displace state policy judgments; it means only that
federal rules cannot displace a State's definition of its
own rights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,
312 U.S. 1, 13-14, 61 S.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941)
(reasoning that "the phrase `substantive rights'"
embraces only those state rights that are sought to be
enforced in the judicial proceedings).
Congress has thus struck a balance: "[H]ousekeeping
rules for federal courts" will generally apply in diversity
cases, notwithstanding that some federal rules "will
inevitably differ" from state rules. Hanna, 380 U.S. at
473, 85 S.Ct. 1136. But not every federal "rul[e] of
practice or procedure," § 2072(a), will displace state law.
To the contrary, federal rules must be interpreted with
some degree of "sensitivity to important state interests
and regulatory policies," Gasperini v. Center for
Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211,
135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), and applied to diversity cases
against the background of Congress' command that such
rules not alter substantive rights and with consideration
of "the degree to which the Rule makes the character
and result of the federal litigation stray from the course
it would follow in state courts," Hanna, 380 U.S. at 473,
85 S.Ct. 1136. This can be a tricky balance to
implement.3
It is important to observe that the balance Congress has
struck turns, in part, on the nature of the state law that
is being displaced by a federal rule. And in my view, the
application of that balance does not necessarily turn on
whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is
traditionally described as substantive or procedural.
Rather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part
of a State's framework of substantive rights or remedies.
See § 2072(b); cf. Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136
("The line between `substance' and `procedure' shifts as
the legal context changes"); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,
326 U.S. 99, 108, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945)
(noting that the words "`substance'" and "`procedure'"
"[e]ach impl[y] different variables depending [130 S.Ct.
1450] upon the particular problem for which [they] are
used").
Applying this balance, therefore, requires careful
interpretation of the state and federal provisions at
issue. "The line between procedural and substantive law
is hazy," Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 92, 58
S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) (Reed, J., concurring),
and matters of procedure and matters of substance are
not "mutually exclusive categories with easily
ascertainable contents," Sibbach, 312 U.S. at 17, 61 S.Ct.
422 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Rather, "[r]ules which
lawyers call procedural do not always exhaust their
effect by regulating procedure," Cohen v. Beneficial
Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 555, 69 S.Ct. 1221,
93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), and in some situations, "procedure
and substance are so interwoven that rational separation
becomes well-nigh impossible," id. at 559, 69 S.Ct. 1221
(Rutledge, J., dissenting). A "state procedural rule,
though undeniably `procedural' in the ordinary sense of
the term," may exist "to influence substantive
outcomes," S.A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewerage Dist., 60 F.3d 305, 310 (C.A.7 1995) (Posner,
J.), and may in some instances become so bound up with
the state-created right or remedy that it defines the
scope of that substantive right or remedy. Such laws, for
example, may be seemingly procedural rules that make it
significantly more difficult to bring or to prove a claim,
thus serving to limit the scope of that claim. See, e.g.,
Cohen, 337 U.S. at 555, 69 S.Ct. 1221 (state "procedure"
that required plaintiffs to post bond before suing);
Guaranty Trust Co., 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed.
2079 (state statute of limitations).4 Such "procedural
rules" may also define the amount of recovery. See, e.g.,
Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (state
procedure for examining jury verdicts as means of
capping the available remedy); Moore § 124.07[3][a]
(listing examples of federal courts' applying state laws
that affect the amount of a judgment).
In our federalist system, Congress has not mandated that
federal courts dictate to state legislatures the form that
their substantive law must take. And were federal courts
to ignore those portions of substantive state law that
operate as procedural devices, it could in many instances
limit the ways that sovereign States may define their
rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a
traditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining
the scope of substantive rights or remedies, federal
courts must recognize and respect that choice. Cf. Ragan
v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530,
533, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520 (1949) ("Since th[e]
cause of action is created by local law, the measure of it
is to be found only in local law . . . . Where local law
qualifies or abridges it, the federal court must follow
suit").
II
When both a federal rule and a state law appear to
govern a question before a federal court sitting in
diversity, our precedents have set out a two-step
framework for federal courts to negotiate this thorny
area. At both steps of the inquiry, there is a critical
question about what the state law and the federal rule
mean.
[130 S.Ct. 1451] The court must first determine whether
the scope of the federal rule is "`sufficiently broad'" to
"`control the issue'" before the court, "thereby leaving
no room for the operation" of seemingly conflicting
state law. See Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods,
480 U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S.Ct. 967, 94 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987);
Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740, 749-750,
and n. 9, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980). If the
federal rule does not apply or can operate alongside the
state rule, then there is no "Ac[t] of Congress"
governing that particular question, 28 U.S.C. § 1652,
and the court must engage in the traditional Rules of
Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In
some instances, the "plain meaning" of a federal rule will
not come into "`direct collision'" with the state law, and
both can operate. Walker, 446 U.S. at 750, n. 9, 749, 100
S.Ct. 1978. In other instances, the rule "when fairly
construed," Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U.S. at 4,
107 S.Ct. 967, with "sensitivity to important state
interests and regulatory policies," Gasperini, 518 U.S. at
427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, will not collide with the state
law.5
If, on the other hand, the federal rule is "sufficiently
broad to control the issue before the Court," such that
there is a "direct collision," Walker, 446 U.S. at 749-750,
100 S.Ct. 1978, the court must decide whether
application of the federal rule "represents a valid
exercise" of the "rulemaking authority . . . bestowed on
this Court by the Rules Enabling Act." Burlington
Northern R. Co., 480 U.S. at 5, 107 S.Ct. 967; see also
Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211; Hanna,
380 U.S. at 471-474, 85 S.Ct. 1136. That Act requires,
inter alia, that federal rules "not abridge, enlarge or
modify any substantive right." 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b)
(emphasis added). Unlike Justice SCALIA, I believe that
an application of a federal rule that effectively abridges,
enlarges, or modifies a state-created right or remedy
violates this command. Congress may have the
constitutional power "to supplant state law" with rules
that are "rationally capable of classification as
procedure," ante at 1442 (internal quotation marks
omitted), but we should generally presume that it has
not done so. Cf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129
S.Ct. 1187, 1194-95, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009) (observing
that "we start with the assumption" that a federal statute
does not displace a State's law "unless that was the clear
and manifest purpose of Congress" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that federal rules
"shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive
right" evinces the opposite intent, as does Congress'
decision to delegate the creation of rules to this Court
rather than to a political branch, see 19 Charles Alan
Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 4509, p. 265 (2d ed.1996)
(hereinafter Wright).
[130 S.Ct. 1452] Thus, the second step of the inquiry may
well bleed back into the first. When a federal rule
appears to abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive
right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can
reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible
result. See, e.g., Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin
Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 503, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 149 L.Ed.2d 32
(2001) (avoiding an interpretation of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 41(b) that "would arguably violate the
jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act"
contained in § 2072(b)).6 And when such a "saving"
construction is not possible and the rule would violate
the Enabling Act, federal courts cannot apply the rule.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b) (mandating that federal rules
"shall not" alter "any substantive right" (emphasis
added)); Hanna, 380 U.S. at 473, 85 S.Ct. 1136 ("[A]
court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards
contained in the Enabling Act. . . need not wholly blind
itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the
character and result of the federal litigation stray from
the course it would follow in state courts"); see also
Semtek Int'l Inc., 531 U.S. at 503-504, 121 S.Ct. 1021
(noting that if state law granted a particular right, "the
federal court's extinguishment of that right . . . would
seem to violate [§ 2072(b)]"); cf. Statement of Justices
Black and Douglas, 374 U.S. 865, 870 (1963) (observing
that federal rules "as applied in given situations might
have to be declared invalid"). A federal rule, therefore,
cannot govern a particular case in which the rule would
displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use
of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or
remedy that it functions to define the scope of the statecreated
right. And absent a governing federal rule, a
federal court must engage in the traditional Rules of
Decision Act inquiry, under the Erie line of cases. This
application of the Enabling Act shows "sensitivity to
important state interests," post at 1463, and "regulatory
policies," post at 1460, but it does so as Congress
authorized, by ensuring that federal rules that ordinarily
"prescribe general rules of practice and procedure," §
2072(a), do "not abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right," § 2072(b).
Justice SCALIA believes that the sole Enabling Act
question is whether the federal rule "really regulates
procedure," ante at 1442, 1444, 1445, 1446, n. 13
(plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted),
which means, apparently, whether it regulates "the
manner and the means by which the litigants' rights are
enforced," ante at 1442 (internal quotation marks
omitted). I respectfully disagree.7 This interpretation of
the Enabling Act is consonant with the Act's first
limitation to "general rules of practice and procedure," §
2072(a). But it ignores the second limitation [130 S.Ct.
1453] that such rules also "not abridge, enlarge or modify
any substantive right," § 2072(b) (emphasis added),8 and
in so doing ignores the balance that Congress struck
between uniform rules of federal procedure and respect
for a State's construction of its own rights and remedies.
It also ignores the separation-of-powers presumption,
see Wright § 4509, at 265, and federalism presumption,
see Wyeth, 555 U.S., at ___, 129 S.Ct. at 1194-95, that
counsel against judicially created rules displacing state
substantive law.9
Although the plurality appears to agree with much of
my interpretation of § 2072, see ante at 1445-1446, it
nonetheless rejects that approach for two reasons, both
of which are mistaken. First, Justice SCALIA worries
that if federal courts inquire into the effect of federal
rules on state law, it will enmesh federal courts in
difficult determinations about whether application [130
S.Ct. 1454] of a given rule would displace a state
determination about substantive rights. See ante at
1443-1444, 1447-1448, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why
an Enabling Act inquiry that looks to state law
necessarily is more taxing than Justice SCALIA's.10 But
in any event, that inquiry is what the Enabling Act
requires: While it may not be easy to decide what is
actually a "substantive right," "the designations
substantive and procedural become important, for the
Enabling Act has made them so." Ely 723; see also
Wright § 4509, at 266. The question, therefore, is not
what rule we think would be easiest on federal courts.
The question is what rule Congress established.
Although, Justice SCALIA may generally prefer easily
administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does not
give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of
the Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and
context in the service of simplicity.
Second, the plurality argues that its interpretation of the
Enabling Act is dictated by this Court's decision in
Sibbach, which applied a Federal Rule about when
parties must submit to medical examinations. But the
plurality misreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan
observed in Hanna, "shorthand formulations which
have appeared in earlier opinions are prone to carry
untoward results that frequently arise from
oversimplification." 380 U.S. at 475, 85 S.Ct. 1136
(concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is first
necessary to understand the issue that was before the
Court. The petitioner raised only the facial question
whether "Rules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to
this court" and not the specific question of "the
obligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law
of a state."11 312 U.S. at 9, 61 S.Ct. 422. The Court,
therefore, had no occasion to consider whether the
particular application of the Federal Rules in question
would offend the Enabling Act.12
[130 S.Ct. 1455] Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis
necessary to the resolution of the case because the
matter at issue, requiring medical exams for litigants, did
not pertain to "substantive rights" under the Enabling
Act. Although most state rules bearing on the litigation
process are adopted for some policy reason, few
seemingly "procedural" rules define the scope of a
substantive right or remedy. The matter at issue in
Sibbach reflected competing federal and state judgments
about privacy interests. Those privacy concerns may
have been weighty and in some sense substantive; but
they did not pertain to the scope of any state right or
remedy at issue in the litigation. Thus, in response to
the petitioner's argument in Sibbach that "substantive
rights" include not only "rights sought to be adjudicated
by the litigants" but also "general principle[s]" or
"question[s] of public policy that the legislature is able to
pass upon," id. at 2-3, 61 S.Ct. 422, we held that "the
phrase `substantive rights'" embraces only state rights,
such as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be
enforced in the judicial proceedings. Id. at 13-14, 61
S.Ct. 422. If the Federal Rule had in fact displaced a state
rule that was sufficiently intertwined with a state right
or remedy, then perhaps the Enabling Act analysis
would have been different.13 Our subsequent cases are
not to the contrary.14
III
Justice GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as
whether and how to [130 S.Ct. 1456] apply a federal rule
that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural
question (whether to join plaintiffs together as a class),
when a state law that "defines the dimensions" of a statecreated
claim dictates the opposite answer. Post at 1458.
As explained above, I readily acknowledge that if a
federal rule displaces a state rule that is "`procedural' in
the ordinary sense of the term," S.A. Healy Co., 60 F.3d
at 310, but sufficiently interwoven with the scope of a
substantive right or remedy, there would be an Enabling
Act problem, and the federal rule would have to give
way. In my view, however, this is not such a case.
Rule 23 Controls Class Certification
When the District Court in the case before us was asked
to certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
23 squarely governed the determination whether the
court should do so. That is the explicit function of Rule
23. Rule 23, therefore, must apply unless its application
would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or
remedies.
Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I
understand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not
govern the question of class certification in this matter
because New York has made a substantive judgment
that such a class should not be certified, as a means of
proscribing damages. Although, as discussed infra at
1469-1471, I do not accept the dissent's view of §
901(b), I also do not see how the dissent's interpretation
of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I agree with
JUSTICE GINSBURG that courts should "avoi[d]
immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that
would trench on state prerogatives," post at 1461-1462,
and should in some instances "interpre[t] the federal
rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory
policies," post at 1462 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But that is not what the dissent has done.
Simply because a rule should be read in light of
federalism concerns, it does not follow that courts may
rewrite the rule.
At bottom, the dissent's interpretation of Rule 23 seems
to be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its
application would create no Erie problem. The dissent
would apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under
Erie even to cases in which there is a governing federal
rule, and thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply.
But "[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal
Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the
typical, [130 S.Ct. 1457] relatively unguided Erie choice."
Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136. The question is
only whether the Enabling Act is satisfied. Although it
reflects a laudable concern to protect "state regulatory
policies," post at 1462 (internal quotation marks
omitted), Justice GINSBURG's approach would, in my
view, work an end run around Congress' system of
uniform federal rules, see 28 U.S.C. § 2072, and our
decision in Hanna. Federal courts can and should
interpret federal rules with sensitivity to "state
prerogatives," post at 1462; but even when "state
interests . . . warrant our respectful consideration," post
at 1464, federal courts cannot rewrite the rules. If my
dissenting colleagues feel strongly that § 901(b) is
substantive and that class certification should be denied,
then they should argue within the Enabling Act's
framework. Otherwise, "the Federal Rule applies
regardless of contrary state law." Gasperini, 518 U.S. at
427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211; accord, Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471,
85 S.Ct. 1136.
Applying Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act
As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a
class action such as this one, a federal court must inquire
whether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify
New York's rights or remedies, and thereby violate the
Enabling Act. This inquiry is not always a simple one
because "[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of
procedure that cannot have a significant effect on the
outcome of a case," Wright § 4508, at 232-233, and
almost "any rule can be said to have . . . `substantive
effects,' affecting society's distribution of risks and
rewards," Ely 724, n. 170. Faced with a federal rule that
dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question
and that displaces a state rule, one can often argue that
the state rule was really some part of the State's
definition of its rights or remedies.
In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling
Act problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law
is designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a
judgment about how state courts ought to operate and
not a judgment about the scope of state-created rights
and remedies. And for the purposes of operating a
federal court system, there are costs involved in
attempting to discover the true nature of a state
procedural rule and allowing such a rule to operate
alongside a federal rule that appears to govern the same
question. The mere possibility that a federal rule would
alter a state-created right is not sufficient. There must
be little doubt.
The text of CPLR § 901(b) expressly and unambiguously
applies not only to claims based on New York law but
also to claims based on federal law or the law of any
other State. And there is no interpretation from New
York courts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see
how § 901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though
procedural in form, serves the function of defining New
York's rights or remedies. This is all the more apparent
because lawsuits under New York law could be joined in
federal class actions well before New York passed §
901(b) in 1975, and New York had done nothing to
prevent that. It is true, as the dissent points out, that
there is a limited amount of legislative history that can
be read to suggest that the New York officials who
supported § 901(b) wished to create a "limitation" on
New York's "statutory damages." Post at 1464. But, as
Justice SCALIA notes, that is not the law that New York
adopted.16 [130 S.Ct. 1458] See ante at 1439-1440
(opinion of the Court).
The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly
describe a judgment that § 901(b) would operate as a
limitation on New York's statutory damages. In
evaluating that legislative history, it is necessary to
distinguish between procedural rules adopted for some
policy reason and seemingly procedural rules that are
intimately bound up in the scope of a substantive right
or remedy. Although almost every rule is adopted for
some reason and has some effect on the outcome of
litigation, not every state rule "defines the dimensions of
[a] claim itself," post at 1466. New York clearly crafted §
901(b) with the intent that only certain lawsuits—those
for which there were not statutory penalties—could be
joined in class actions in New York courts. That
decision reflects a policy judgment about which lawsuits
should proceed in New York courts in a class form and
which should not. As Justice GINSBURG carefully
outlines, see post at 1464-1465, § 901(b) was
"apparently" adopted in response to fears that the classaction
procedure, applied to statutory penalties, would
lead to "annihilating punishment of the defendant." V.
Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted
in 7B McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York
Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 8 N.Y.3d 204, 211,
831 N.Y.S.2d 760, 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1015 (2007). But
statements such as these are not particularly strong
evidence that § 901(b) serves to define who can obtain a
statutory penalty or that certifying such a class would
enlarge New York's remedy. Any device that makes
litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to recover
damages.
In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some
opponents of a broad class-action device "argued that
there was no need to permit class actions in order to
encourage litigation . . . when statutory penalties . . .
provided an aggrieved party with a sufficient economic
incentive to pursue a claim." Id., at 211, 831 N.Y.S.2d
760, 863 N.E.2d, at 1015 (emphasis added). But those
opponents may have felt merely that, for any number of
reasons, New York courts should not conduct trials in
the class format when that format is unnecessary [130
S.Ct. 1459] to motivate litigation.17 Justice GINSBURG
asserts that this could not be true because "suits seeking
statutory damages are arguably best suited to the class
device because individual proof of actual damages is
unnecessary." Post at 1464-1465. But some people
believe that class actions are inefficient or at least unfair,
insofar as they join together slightly disparate claims or
force courts to adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for
us to dismiss the possibility that New York legislators
shared in those beliefs and thus wanted to exclude the
class vehicle when it appeared to be unnecessary.
The legislative history of § 901 thus reveals a classically
procedural calibration of making it easier to litigate
claims in New York courts (under any source of law)
only when it is necessary to do so, and not making it too
easy when the class tool is not required. This is the same
sort of calculation that might go into setting filing fees
or deadlines for briefs. There is of course a difference of
degree between those examples and class certification,
but not a difference of kind; the class vehicle may have a
greater practical effect on who brings lawsuits than do
low filing fees, but that does not transform it into a
damages "proscription," post at 1466, n. 6, 1471, or
"limitation," post at 1463, n. 2, 1464, 1464-1465, 1466,
1473.18
The difference of degree is relevant to the forum
shopping considerations that are part of the Rules of
Decision Act or Erie inquiry. If the applicable federal
rule did not govern the particular question at issue (or
could be fairly read not to do so), then those
considerations would matter, for precisely the reasons
given by the dissent. See post at 1469-1473. But that is
not this case. As the Court explained in Hanna, it is an
"incorrect assumption that the rule of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins constitutes the appropriate test of . . . the
applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure." 380
U.S. at 469-470, 85 S.Ct. 1136. "It is true that both the
Enabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal
courts are to apply state `substantive' law and federal
`procedural' law," but the tests are different and reflect
the fact that "they were designed to control very
different sorts of decisions." Id. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only
decision is whether certifying a class in this diversity
case would "abridge, enlarge or modify" New York's
substantive rights or remedies. § 2072(b). Although one
can argue that class certification would enlarge New
York's "limited" damages remedy, see post at 1463, n. 2,
1464, 1464-1465, 1466, 1473, such arguments rest on
extensive speculation about what the New York
Legislature had in mind when it created § 901(b). But
given that there are two plausible competing narratives,
it seems obvious to me that we [130 S.Ct. 1460] should
respect the plain textual reading of § 901(b), a rule in
New York's procedural code about when to certify class
actions brought under any source of law, and respect
Congress' decision that Rule 23 governs class
certification in federal courts. In order to displace a
federal rule, there must be more than just a possibility
that the state rule is different than it appears.
Accordingly, I concur in part and concur in the
judgment.
