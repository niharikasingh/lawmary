While I agree with the result reached in this case, I write
separately to state my views on two points.
First, I, for one, would not close the door upon the
possibility that there are cases in which the doctrine of
res judicata [452 U.S. 403] must give way to what the
Court of Appeals referred to as "overriding concerns of
public policy and simple justice." 611 F.2d 1267, 1269
(CA9 1980). Professor Moore has noted: "Just as res
judicata is occasionally qualified by an overriding,
competing principle of public policy, so occasionally it
needs an equitable tempering." 1B J. Moore & T.
Currier, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.405 [12], p. 791
(1980) (footnote omitted). See also Reed v. Allen, 286
U.S. 191, 209 (1932) (Cardozo, J., joined by Brandeis and
Stone, JJ., dissenting) ("A system of procedure is
perverted from its proper function when it multiplies
impediments to justice without the warrant of clear
necessity"). But this case is clearly not one in which
equity requires that the doctrine give way. Unlike the
nonappealing party in Reed, respondents were not
"caught in a mesh of procedural complexities." Ibid.
Instead, they made a deliberate tactical decision not to
appeal. Nor would public policy be served by making an
exception to the doctrine in this case; to the contrary,
there is a special need for strict application of res
judicata in complex multiple party actions of this sort so
as to discourage "break-away" litigation. Cf. Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345 (1979). Finally, this is
not a case "where the rights of appealing and nonappealing
parties are so interwoven or dependent on
each other as to require a reversal of the whole
judgment when a part thereof is reversed." See Ford
Motor Credit Co. v. Uresti, 581 S.W.2d 298, 300 (Tex.
Civ. App. 1979).*
[452 U.S. 404] Second, and in contrast, I would flatly
hold that Brown I is res judicata as to respondents' statelaw
claims. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals
found that those state-law claims were simply disguised
federal claims; since respondents have not crosspetitioned
from that judgment, their argument that this
case should be remanded to state court should be itself
barred by res judicata. More important, even if the state
and federal claims are distinct, respondents' failure to
allege the state claims in Brown I manifestly bars their
allegation in Brown II. The dismissal of Brown I is res
judicata not only as to all claims respondents actually
raised, but also as to all claims that could have been
raised. See Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597
(1948); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 61.1
(Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 10, 1978). Since there is no
reason to believe that it was clear at the outset of this
litigation that the District Court would have declined to
exercise pendent jurisdiction over state claims,
respondents were obligated to plead those claims if they
wished to preserve them. See id., § 61.1, Comment e.
Because they did not do so, I would hold the claims
barred.
