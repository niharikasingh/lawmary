I agree with the opinion of the Court that the initial
question before us is whether the validity between the
parties of a contractual forum-selection clause falls
within the scope of 28 U. S. C. § 1404(a). See ante, at 26-
27, 29. I cannot agree, however, that the answer to that
question is yes. Nor do I believe that the federal courts
can, consistent with the twin-aims test of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), fashion a judge-made
rule to govern this issue of contract validity.
[487 U.S. 34] I
When a litigant asserts that state law conflicts with a
federal procedural statute or formal Rule of Procedure, a
court's first task is to determine whether the disputed
point in question in fact falls within the scope of the
federal statute or Rule. In this case, the Court must
determine whether the scope of § 1404(a) is sufficiently
broad to cause a direct collision with state law or
implicitly to control the issue before the Court, i. e.,
validity between the parties of the forum-selection
clause, thereby leaving no room for the operation of
state law. See Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods,
480 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1987). I conclude that it is not.
Although the language of § 1404(a) provides no clear
answer, in my view it does provide direction. The
provision vests the district courts with authority to
transfer a civil action to another district "[f]or the
convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of
justice." This language looks to the present and the
future. As the specific reference to convenience of
parties and witnesses suggests, it requires consideration
of what is likely to be just in the future, when the case is
tried, in light of things as they now stand. Accordingly,
the courts in applying § 1404(a) have examined a variety
of factors, each of which pertains to facts that currently
exist or will exist: e. g., the forum actually chosen by the
plaintiff, the current convenience of the parties and
witnesses, the current location of pertinent books and
records, similar litigation pending elsewhere, current
docket conditions, and familiarity of the potential courts
with governing state law. See 15 C. Wright, A. Miller, &
E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §§ 3848-
3849, 3851, 3853-3854 (2d ed. 1986). In holding that the
validity between the parties of a forum-selection clause
falls within the scope of § 1404(a), the Court inevitably
imports, in my view without adequate textual
foundation, a new retrospective element into the court's
deliberations, requiring examination of what the [487
U.S. 35] facts were concerning, among other things, the
bargaining power of the parties and the presence or
absence of overreaching at the time the contract was
made. See ante, at 28, and n. 7, 29.
The Court largely attempts to avoid acknowledging the
novel scope it gives to § 1404(a) by casting the issue as
how much weight a district court should give a forumselection
clause as against other factors when it makes
its determination under § 1404(a). I agree that if the
weight-among-factors issue were before us, it would be
governed by § 1404 (a). That is because, while the
parties may decide who between them should bear any
inconvenience, only a court can decide how much
weight should be given under § 1404(a) to the factor of
the parties' convenience as against other relevant factors
such as the convenience of witnesses. But the Court's
description of the issue begs the question: what law
governs whether the forum-selection clause is a valid or
invalid allocation of any inconvenience between the
parties. If it is invalid, i. e., should be voided, between
the parties, it cannot be entitled to any weight in the §
1404(a) determination. Since under Alabama law the
forum-selection clause should be voided, see Redwing
Carriers, Inc. v. Foster, 382 So.2d 554, 556 (Ala. 1980),
in this case the question of what weight should be given
the forum-selection clause can be reached only if as a
preliminary matter federal law controls the issue of the
validity of the clause between the parties.*
[487 U.S. 36] Second, § 1404(a) was enacted against the
background that issues of contract, including a contract's
validity, are nearly always governed by state law. It is
simply contrary to the practice of our system that such
an issue should be wrenched from state control in
absence of a clear conflict with federal law or explicit
statutory provision. It is particularly instructive in this
regard to compare § 1404(a) with another provision,
enacted by the same Congress a year earlier, that did
pre-empt state contract law, and in precisely the same
field of agreement regarding forum selection. Section 2
of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 2, provides:
"A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction
involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy
thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal
to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in
writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out
of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract."
We have said that an arbitration clause is a "kind of
forum-selection clause," Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,
417 U.S. 506, 519 (1974), and the contrast between this
explicit pre-emption [487 U.S. 37] of state contract law
on the subject and § 1404(a) could not be more stark.
Section 1404(a) is simply a venue provision that
nowhere mentions contracts or agreements, much less
that the validity of certain contracts or agreements will
be matters of federal law. It is difficult to believe that
state contract law was meant to be pre-empted by this
provision that we have said "should be regarded as a
federal judicial housekeeping measure," Van Dusen v.
Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 636-637 (1964), that we have said
did not change "the relevant factors" which federal
courts used to consider under the doctrine of forum non
conveniens, Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U.S. 29, 32
(1955), and that we have held can be applied
retroactively because it is procedural, Ex parte Collett,
337 U.S. 55, 71 (1949). It seems to me the generality of
its language — "[f]or the convenience of parties and
witnesses, in the interest of justice" — is plainly
insufficient to work the great change in law asserted
here.
Third, it has been common ground in this Court since
Erie, 304 U. S., at 74-77, that when a federal procedural
statute or Rule of Procedure is not on point, substantial
uniformity of predictable outcome between federal and
state courts in adjudicating claims should be striven for.
See also Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 313
U.S. 487, 496 (1941). This rests upon a perception of the
constitutional and congressional plan underlying the
creation of diversity and pendent jurisdiction in the
lower federal courts, which should quite obviously be
carried forward into our interpretation of ambiguous
statutes relating to the exercise of that jurisdiction. We
should assume, in other words, when it is fair to do so,
that Congress is just as concerned as we have been to
avoid significant differences between state and federal
courts in adjudicating claims. Cf. Southland Corp. v.
Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 15 (1984) (interpreting Federal
Arbitration Act to apply to claims brought in state
courts in order to discourage forum shopping). Thus, in
deciding whether a federal procedural statute or Rule of
Procedure encompasses a particular [487 U.S. 38] issue, a
broad reading that would create significant
disuniformity between state and federal courts should be
avoided if the text permits. See, e. g., Walker v. Armco
Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740, 750-751 (1980); Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 556
(1949); Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117 (1943); cf.
P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System
828 (3d ed. 1988) ("The Supreme Court has continued
since Hanna to interpret the federal rules to avoid
conflict with important state regulatory policies"). As I
have shown, the interpretation given § 1404(a) by the
Court today is neither the plain nor the more natural
meaning; at best, § 1404(a) is ambiguous. I would
therefore construe it to avoid the significant
encouragement to forum shopping that will inevitably
be provided by the interpretation the Court adopts
today.
II
Since no federal statute or Rule of Procedure governs
the validity of a forum-selection clause, the remaining
issue is whether federal courts may fashion a judgemade
rule to govern the question. If they may not, the
Rules of Decision Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1652, mandates use
of state law. See Erie, supra, at 72-73; Hanna v. Plumer,
380 U.S. 460, 471-472 (1965) (if federal courts lack
authority to fashion a rule, "state law must govern
because there can be no other law"); DelCostello v.
Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 174, n. 1 (1983) (O'CONNOR,
J., dissenting) (Rules of Decision Act "simply requires
application of state law unless federal law applies"); see
also id., at 159, n. 13.
In general, while interpreting and applying substantive
law is the essence of the "judicial Power" created under
Article III of the Constitution, that power does not
encompass the making of substantive law. Cf. Erie,
supra, at 78-79. Whatever the scope of the federal
courts' authority to create federal common law in other
areas, it is plain that the mere [487 U.S. 39] fact that
petitioner company here brought an antitrust claim,
ante, at 24, does not empower the federal courts to make
common law on the question of the validity of the
forum-selection clause. See Campbell v. Haverhill, 155
U.S. 610, 616 (1895) (Rules of Decision Act "itself
neither contains nor suggests . . . a distinction" between
federal-question cases and diversity cases); DelCostello,
supra, at 173, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (same); cf.
Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S.
630 (1981). The federal courts do have authority,
however, to make procedural rules that govern the
practice before them. See 28 U. S. C. § 2071 (federal
courts may make rules "for the conduct of their
business"); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83 (districts courts have
authority to "regulate their practice"); see generally
Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1941).
In deciding what is substantive and what is procedural
for these purposes, we have adhered to a functional test
based on the "twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement
of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable
administration of the laws." Hanna, supra, at 468; see
also ante, at 27, n. 6; Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.,
supra, at 747. Moreover, although in reviewing the
validity of a federal procedural statute or Rule of
Procedure we inquire only whether Congress or the
rulemakers have trespassed beyond the wide latitude
given them to determine that a matter is procedural, see
Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S., at 5;
Hanna, supra, at 471-474, in reviewing the lower courts'
application of the twin-aims test we apply our own
judgment as a matter of law.
Under the twin-aims test, I believe state law controls the
question of the validity of a forum-selection clause
between the parties. The Eleventh Circuit's rule clearly
encourages forum shopping. Venue is often a vitally
important matter, as is shown by the frequency with
which parties contractually provide for and litigate the
issue. Suit might well not be pursued, or might not be as
successful, in a significantly less [487 U.S. 40]
convenient forum. Transfer to such a less desirable
forum is, therefore, of sufficient import that plaintiffs
will base their decisions on the likelihood of that
eventuality when they are choosing whether to sue in
state or federal court. With respect to forum-selection
clauses, in a State with law unfavorable to validity,
plaintiffs who seek to avoid the effect of a clause will be
encouraged to sue in state court, and non-resident
defendants will be encouraged to shop for more
favorable law by removing to federal court. In the
reverse situation — where a State has law favorable to
enforcing such clauses — plaintiffs will be encouraged to
sue in federal court. This significant encouragement to
forum shopping is alone sufficient to warrant
application of state law. Cf. Walker v. Armco Steel
Corp., supra, at 753 (failure to meet one part of the
twin-aims test suffices to warrant application of state
law).
I believe creating a judge-made rule fails the second part
of the twin-aims test as well, producing inequitable
administration of the laws. The best explanation of what
constitutes inequitable administration of the laws is that
found in Erie itself: allowing an unfair discrimination
between noncitizens and citizens of the forum state. 304
U. S., at 74-75; see also Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9.
Whether discrimination is unfair in this context largely
turns on how important is the matter in question. See
id., at 467-468, and n. 9. The decision of an important
legal issue should not turn on the accident of diversity of
citizenship, see, e. g., Walker, supra, at 753, or the
presence of a federal question unrelated to that issue. It
is difficult to imagine an issue of more importance,
other than one that goes to the very merits of the
lawsuit, than the validity of a contractual forumselection
provision. Certainly, the Erie doctrine has
previously been held to require the application of state
law on subjects of similar or obviously lesser
importance. See, e. g., Walker, supra (whether filing of
complaint or service tolls statute of limitations);
Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.S. 198,
202-204 (1956) [487 U.S. 41] (arbitrability); Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S., at 555-556
(indemnity bond for litigation expenses). Nor can or
should courts ignore that issues of contract validity are
traditionally matters governed by state law.
For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.
