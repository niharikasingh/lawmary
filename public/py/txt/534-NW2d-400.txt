Appellant, Heath Benjamin, found over $18,000 in
currency inside the wing of an airplane. At the time of
this discovery, appellee, State Central Bank, owned the
plane and it was being serviced by appellee, Lindner
Aviation, Inc. All three parties claimed the money as
against the true owner. After a bench trial, the district
court held that the currency was mislaid property and
belonged to the owner of the plane. The court awarded
a finder's fee to Benjamin. Benjamin appealed and
Lindner Aviation and State Central Bank crossappealed.
We reverse on the bank's cross-appeal and
otherwise affirm the judgment of the district court.
I. Background Facts and Proceedings.
In April of 1992, State Central Bank became the owner
of an airplane when the bank repossessed it from its
prior owner who had defaulted on a loan. In August of
that year, the bank took the plane to Lindner Aviation
for a routine annual inspection. Benjamin worked for
Lindner Aviation and did the inspection.
As part of the inspection, Benjamin removed panels
from the underside of the wings. Although these panels
were to be removed annually as part of the routine
inspection, a couple of the screws holding the panel on
the left wing were so rusty that Benjamin had to use a
drill to remove them. Benjamin testified that the panel
probably had not been removed for several years.
Inside the left wing Benjamin discovered two packets
approximately four inches high and wrapped in
aluminum foil. He removed the packets from the wing
and took off the foil wrapping. Inside the foil was paper
currency, tied in string and wrapped in handkerchiefs.
The currency was predominately twenty-dollar bills
with mint dates before the 1960s, primarily in the 1950s.
The money smelled musty.
Benjamin took one packet to his jeep and then reported
what he had found to his supervisor, offering to divide
the money with him. However, the supervisor reported
the discovery to the owner of Lindner Aviation,
William Engle. Engle insisted that they contact the
authorities and he called the Department of Criminal
Investigation. The money was eventually turned over to
the Keokuk police department.
Two days later, Benjamin filed an affidavit with the
county auditor claiming that he was the finder of the
currency under the provisions of Iowa Code chapter 644
(1991).1 Lindner Aviation and the bank also filed claims
to the money. The notices required by chapter 644 were
published and posted. See Iowa Code § 644.8 (1991). No
one came forward within twelve months claiming to be
the true owner of the money. See id. § 644.11 (if true
owner does not claim property within twelve months,
the right to the property vests in the finder).
[534 N.W.2d 404] Benjamin filed this declaratory
judgment action against Lindner Aviation and the bank
to establish his right to the property. The parties tried
the case to the court. The district court held that chapter
644 applies only to "lost" property and the money here
was mislaid property. The court awarded the money to
the bank, holding that it was entitled to possession of
the money to the exclusion of all but the true owner.
The court also held that Benjamin was a "finder" within
the meaning of chapter 644 and awarded him a ten
percent finder's fee. See id. § 644.13 (a finder of lost
property is entitled to ten percent of the value of the lost
property as a reward).
Benjamin appealed. He claims that chapter 644 governs
the disposition of all found property and any common
law distinctions between various types of found
property are no longer valid. He asserts alternatively
that even under the common law classes of found
property, he is entitled to the money he discovered. He
claims that the trial court should have found that the
property was treasure trove or was lost or abandoned
rather than mislaid, thereby entitling the finder to the
property.
The bank and Lindner Aviation cross-appealed. Lindner
Aviation claims that if the money is mislaid property, it
is entitled to the money as the owner of the premises on
which the money was found, the hangar where the
plane was parked. It argues in the alternative that it is
the finder, not Benjamin, because Benjamin discovered
the money during his work for Lindner Aviation. The
bank asserts in its cross-appeal that it owns the premises
where the money was found—the airplane—and that no
one is entitled to a finder's fee because chapter 644 does
not apply to mislaid property.
II. Standard of Review.
This case was tried as an ordinary proceeding at law.
Therefore, the standard of review is for correction of
errors at law. Iowa R.App.P. 4; Kuehl v. Freeman Bros.
Agency, Inc., 521 N.W.2d 714, 717 (Iowa 1994);
Eldridge v. Herman, 291 N.W.2d 319, 321 (Iowa 1980).
Whether the money found by Benjamin was treasure
trove or was mislaid, abandoned or lost property is a fact
question. 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned, Lost, and Unclaimed
Property § 41, at 49 (2d ed. 1994) (hereinafter "1
Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property "); cf. Bennett v.
Bowers, 238 Iowa 702, 706, 28 N.W.2d 618, 620 (1947)
(whether realty has been abandoned is a question of
fact); Roberson v. Ellis, 58 Or. 219, 114 P. 100, 103
(1911) (whether money was hidden long enough to be
classified as treasure trove was a fact question for the
jury). Therefore, the trial court's finding that the money
was mislaid is binding on us if supported by substantial
evidence. Iowa R.App.P. 14(f)(1); see Eldridge, 291
N.W.2d at 323 (affirming trial court's finding that
property was lost property because supported by
substantial evidence).
III. Does Chapter 644 Supersede the Common Law
Classifications of Found Property?
Benjamin argues that chapter 644 governs the rights of
finders of property and abrogates the common law
distinctions between types of found property. As he
points out, lost property statutes are intended "to
encourage and facilitate the return of property to the
true owner, and then to reward a finder for his honesty
if the property remains unclaimed." Paset v. Old
Orchard Bank & Trust Co., 62 Ill.App.3d 534, 19 Ill.Dec.
389, 393, 378 N.E.2d 1264, 1268 (1978) (interpreting a
statute similar to chapter 644); accord Flood v. City Nat'l
Bank, 218 Iowa 898, 908, 253 N.W. 509, 514 (1934),
cert. denied, 298 U.S. 666, 56 S.Ct. 749, 80 L.Ed. 1390
(1936) (public policy reflected in lost property statute is
"to provide a reward to the finder of lost goods");
Willsmore v. Township of Oceola, 106 Mich.App. 671,
308 N.W.2d 796, 804 (1981) (lost goods act "provides
protection to the finder, a reasonable method of uniting
goods with their true owner, and a plan which benefits
the people of the state through their local
governments").2 These [534 N.W.2d 405] goals,
Benjamin argues, can best be achieved by applying such
statutes to all types of found property.
The Michigan Court of Appeals had an additional
reason in Willsmore to apply the Michigan statute to all
classes of discovered property. The Michigan court
noted that the common law distinctions between
categories of found property were embraced in
Michigan after the enactment of its lost property statute.
Willsmore, 308 N.W.2d at 803. Based on this fact, the
Michigan court concluded that the legislature could not
have intended to reflect in the term "lost property"
distinctions not then in existence. Id. However, the
Michigan court did not address the fact that the
common law distinctions were first developed in
England, before the enactment of most states' lost
property statutes.3 See Goodard v. Winchell, 86 Iowa 71,
52 N.W. 1124 (1892) (citing to English common law);
Hurley v. City of Niagara Falls, 30 A.D.2d 89, 289
N.Y.S.2d 889, 891 (1968) (stating that common law
principles relating to lost property were established as
early as 1722).
Although a few courts have adopted an expansive view
of lost property statutes, we think Iowa law is to the
contrary. In 1937, we quoted and affirmed a trial court
ruling that "the old law of treasure trove is not merged
in the statutory law of chapter 515, 1935 Code of Iowa."
Zornes v. Bowen, 223 Iowa 1141, 1145, 274 N.W. 877,
879 (1937). Chapter 515 of the 1935 Iowa Code was
eventually renumbered as chapter 644. The relevant
sections of chapter 644 are unchanged since our 1937
decision. As recently as 1991, we stated that "[t]he rights
of finders of property vary according to the
characterization of the property found." Ritz v. Selma
United Methodist Church, 467 N.W.2d 266, 268 (Iowa
1991). We went on to define and apply the common law
classifications of found property in deciding the rights of
the parties. Id. at 269. As our prior cases show, we have
continued to use the common law distinctions between
classes of found property despite the legislature's
enactment of chapter 644 and its predecessors.
The legislature has had many opportunities since our
decision in Zornes to amend the statute so that it clearly
applies to all types of found property. However, it has
not done so. When the legislature leaves a statute
unchanged after the supreme court has interpreted it,
we presume the legislature has acquiesced in our
interpretation. State v. Sheffey, 234 N.W.2d 92, 97
(Iowa 1975). Therefore, we presume here that the
legislature approves of our application of chapter 644 to
lost property only. Consequently, we hold that chapter
644 does not abrogate the common law classifications of
found property. We note this position is consistent with
that taken by most jurisdictions. See, e.g., Bishop v.
Ellsworth, 91 Ill.App.2d 386, 234 N.E.2d 49, 51 (1968)
(holding lost property statute does not apply to
abandoned or mislaid property); Foster v. Fidelity Safe
Deposit Co., 264 Mo. 89, 174 S.W. 376, 379 (1915)
(refusing to apply lost property statute to property that
would not be considered lost under the common law);
Sovern v. Yoran, 16 Or. 269, 20 P. 100, 105 (1888)
(same); Zech v. Accola, 253 Wis. 80, 33 N.W.2d 232,
235 (1948) (concluding that if legislature had intended
to include treasure trove within lost property statute, it
would have specifically mentioned treasure trove).
In summary, chapter 644 applies only if the property
discovered can be categorized as "lost" property as that
term is defined under the common law. Thus, the trial
court correctly looked to the common law classifications
of found property to decide who had the right to the
money discovered here.
[534 N.W.2d 406] IV. Classification of Found
Property.
Under the common law, there are four categories of
found property: (1) abandoned property, (2) lost
property, (3) mislaid property, and (4) treasure trove.
Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269. The rights of a finder of
property depend on how the found property is
classified. Id. at 268-69.
A. Abandoned property. Property is abandoned when
the owner no longer wants to possess it. Cf. Pearson v.
City of Guttenberg, 245 N.W.2d 519, 529 (Iowa 1976)
(considering abandonment of real estate). Abandonment
is shown by proof that the owner intends to abandon
the property and has voluntarily relinquished all right,
title and interest in the property. Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at
269; 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property §§ 11-14, at 15-
20. Abandoned property belongs to the finder of the
property against all others, including the former owner.
Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269.
B. Lost property. "Property is lost when the owner
unintentionally and involuntarily parts with its
possession and does not know where it is." Id. (citing
Eldridge v. Herman, 291 N.W.2d 319, 323 (Iowa 1980));
accord 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 4, at 9-10.
Stolen property found by someone who did not
participate in the theft is lost property. Flood, 218 Iowa
at 905, 253 N.W. at 513; 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned
Property § 5, at 11. Under chapter 644, lost property
becomes the property of the finder once the statutory
procedures are followed and the owner makes no claim
within twelve months. Iowa Code § 644.11 (1991).
C. Mislaid property. Mislaid property is voluntarily put
in a certain place by the owner who then overlooks or
forgets where the property is. Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269.
It differs from lost property in that the owner
voluntarily and intentionally places mislaid property in
the location where it is eventually found by another. 1
Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 10, at 14. In contrast,
property is not considered lost unless the owner parts
with it involuntarily. Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269; 1
Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 10, at 14; see Hill v.
Schrunk, 207 Or. 71, 292 P.2d 141, 143 (1956) (carefully
concealed currency was mislaid property, not lost
property).
The finder of mislaid property acquires no rights to the
property. 1 Am. Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 24, at 30.
The right of possession of mislaid property belongs to
the owner of the premises upon which the property is
found, as against all persons other than the true owner.
Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269.
D. Treasure trove. Treasure trove consists of coins or
currency concealed by the owner. Id. It includes an
element of antiquity. Id. To be classified as treasure
trove, the property must have been hidden or concealed
for such a length of time that the owner is probably dead
or undiscoverable. Id.; 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property
§ 8, at 13. Treasure trove belongs to the finder as against
all but the true owner. Zornes, 223 Iowa at 1145, 274
N.W. at 879.
V. Is There Substantial Evidence to Support the Trial
Court's Finding That the Money Found by Benjamin
Was Mislaid?
We think there was substantial evidence to find that the
currency discovered by Benjamin was mislaid property.
In the Eldridge case, we examined the location where
the money was found as a factor in determining whether
the money was lost property. Eldridge, 291 N.W.2d at
323; accord 1 Am. Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 6, at
11-12 ("The place where money or property claimed as
lost is found is an important factor in the determination
of the question of whether it was lost or only mislaid.").
Similarly, in Ritz, we considered the manner in which
the money had been secreted in deciding that it had not
been abandoned. Ritz, 467 N.W.2d at 269.
The place where Benjamin found the money and the
manner in which it was hidden are also important here.
The bills were carefully tied and wrapped and then
concealed in a location that was accessible only by
removing screws and a panel. These circumstances
support an inference that the money was placed there
intentionally. This [534 N.W.2d 407] inference supports
the conclusion that the money was mislaid. Jackson v.
Steinberg, 186 Or. 129, 200 P.2d 376, 378 (1948) (fact
that $800 in currency was found concealed beneath the
paper lining of a dresser indicates that money was
intentionally concealed with intention of reclaiming it;
therefore, property was mislaid, not lost); Schley v.
Couch, 155 Tex. 195, 284 S.W.2d 333, 336 (1955)
(holding that money found buried under garage floor
was mislaid property as a matter of law because
circumstances showed that money was placed there
deliberately and court presumed that owner had either
forgotten where he hid the money or had died before
retrieving it).
The same facts that support the trial court's conclusion
that the money was mislaid prevent us from ruling as a
matter of law that the property was lost. Property is not
considered lost unless considering the place where and
the conditions under which the property is found, there
is an inference that the property was left there
unintentionally. 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 6,
at 12; see Sovern, 20 P. at 105 (holding that coins found
in a jar under a wooden floor of a barn were not lost
property because the circumstances showed that the
money was hidden there intentionally); see Farrare v.
City of Pasco, 68 Wn.App. 459, 843 P.2d 1082, 1084
(1993) (where currency was deliberately concealed, it
cannot be characterized as lost property). Contrary to
Benjamin's position the circumstances here do not
support a conclusion that the money was placed in the
wing of the airplane unintentionally. Additionally, as the
trial court concluded, there was no evidence suggesting
that the money was placed in the wing by someone
other than the owner of the money and that its location
was unknown to the owner. For these reasons, we reject
Benjamin's argument that the trial court was obligated
to find that the currency Benjamin discovered was lost
property.
We also reject Benjamin's assertion that as a matter of
law this money was abandoned property. Both logic and
common sense suggest that it is unlikely someone would
voluntarily part with over $18,000 with the intention of
terminating his ownership. The location where this
money was found is much more consistent with the
conclusion that the owner of the property was placing
the money there for safekeeping. See Ritz, 467 N.W.2d
at 269 (property not abandoned where money was
buried in jars and tin cans, indicating a desire by the
owner to preserve it); Jackson, 200 P.2d at 378 (because
currency was concealed intentionally and deliberately,
the bills could not be regarded as abandoned property);
1 Am. Jur.2d Abandoned Property § 13, at 17 (where
property is concealed in such a way that the
concealment appears intentional and deliberate, there
can be no abandonment). We will not presume that an
owner has abandoned his property when his conduct is
consistent with a continued claim to the property.
Linscomb v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 199 F.2d 431,
435 (8th Cir.1952) (applying Missouri law); Hoffman
Management Corp. v. S.L.C. of N. Am., Inc., 800
S.W.2d 755, 762 (Mo.Ct.App.1990); Foulke v. New
York Consolidated R.R., 228 N.Y. 269, 127 N.E. 237,
238 (1920); 1 Am.Jur.2d Abandoned Property §§ 14, 42,
at 20, 49; cf. Bennett, 238 Iowa at 706, 28 N.W.2d at 620
(stating that there is no presumption that real property
is abandoned). Therefore, we cannot rule that the
district court erred in failing to find that the currency
discovered by Benjamin was abandoned property.
Finally, we also conclude that the trial court was not
obligated to decide that this money was treasure trove.
Based on the dates of the currency, the money was no
older than thirty-five years. The mint dates, the musty
odor and the rusty condition of a few of the panel
screws indicate that the money may have been hidden
for some time. However, there was no evidence of the
age of the airplane or the date of its last inspection.
These facts may have shown that the money was
concealed for a much shorter period of time.
Moreover, it is also significant that the airplane had a
well-documented ownership history. The record reveals
that there were only two owners of the plane prior to
the bank. One was the person from whom the bank
repossessed the plane; the other [534 N.W.2d 408] was
the original purchaser of the plane when it was
manufactured. Nevertheless, there is no indication that
Benjamin or any other party attempted to locate and
notify the prior owners of the plane, which could very
possibly have led to the identification of the true owner
of the money. Under these circumstances, we cannot say
as a matter of law that the money meets the antiquity
requirement or that it is probable that the owner of the
money is not discoverable.
We think the district court had substantial evidence to
support its finding that the money found by Benjamin
was mislaid. The circumstances of its concealment and
the location where it was found support inferences that
the owner intentionally placed the money there and
intended to retain ownership. We are bound by this
factual finding.
VI. Is the Airplane Or the Hangar the "Premises" Where
the Money Was Discovered?
Because the money discovered by Benjamin was
properly found to be mislaid property, it belongs to the
owner of the premises where it was found. Mislaid
property is entrusted to the owner of the premises
where it is found rather than the finder of the property
because it is assumed that the true owner may eventually
recall where he has placed his property and return there
to reclaim it. Willsmore, 308 N.W.2d at 802; Foster, 174
S.W. at 378; Foulke, 127 N.E. at 238-39.
We think that the premises where the money was found
is the airplane, not Lindner Aviation's hangar where the
airplane happened to be parked when the money was
discovered. The policy behind giving ownership of
mislaid property to the owner of the premises where the
property was mislaid supports this conclusion. If the
true owner of the money attempts to locate it, he would
initially look for the plane; it is unlikely he would begin
his search by contacting businesses where the airplane
might have been inspected. Therefore, we affirm the
trial court's judgment that the bank, as the owner of the
plane, has the right to possession of the property as
against all but the true owner.4
VII. Is Benjamin Entitled to a Finder's Fee?
Benjamin claims that if he is not entitled to the money,
he should be paid a ten percent finder's fee under section
644.13. The problem with this claim is that only the
finder of "lost goods, money, bank notes, and other
things" is rewarded with a finder's fee under chapter
644. Iowa Code § 644.13 (1991). Because the property
found by Benjamin was mislaid property, not lost
property, section 644.13 does not apply here. The trial
court erred in awarding Benjamin a finder's fee.
VIII. Summary.
We conclude that the district court's finding that the
money discovered by Benjamin was mislaid property is
supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we affirm
the district court's judgment that the bank has the right
to the money as against all but the true owner. This
decision makes it unnecessary to decide whether
Benjamin or Lindner Aviation was the finder of the
property. We reverse the court's decision awarding a
finder's fee to Benjamin.
AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.
