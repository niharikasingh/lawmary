The plaintiff, W. D. Carroll, is, and was at the time of entering into the service of the defendant, the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, and at the time of being injured in that service, a citizen of Alabama. The defendant is an Alabama corporation, operating a railroad extending from Chattanooga, in the state of Tennessee, through Alabama to Meridian, in the state of Mississippi. At the time of the casualty complained of plaintiff was in the service of the defendant in the capacity of brakeman on freight trains running from Birmingham, Ala., to Meridian, Miss., under a contract which was made in the state of Alabama. The injury was caused by the breaking of a link between two cars in a freight train which was proceeding from Birmingham to Meridian. The point at which the link broke and the injury was suffered was in the state of Mississippi. The evidence tended to show that the link which broke was a defective link, and that it was in a defective condition when the train left Birmingham. 
The evidence went also to show that the defect in this link consisted in or resulted from its having been bent while cold; that this tended to weaken the iron, and in this instance had cracked the link somewhat on the outer curve of the bend, and that the link broke at the point of this crack. It was shown to be the duty of certain employees of defendant stationed along its line to inspect the links attached to cars to be put in trains, or forming the couplings between cars in trains at Chattanooga, Birmingham, and some points between Birmingham and the place where this link broke, and also that it was the duty of the conductor of freight trains, and the other train men, to maintain such inspection as occasion afforded throughout the runs or trips of such trains; and the evidence affords ground for inference that there was a negligent omission on the part of such employees to perform this duty, or, if performed, the failure to discover the defect in, and to remove, this link was the result of negligence.
The foregoing statement of facts, either proved or finding lodgment in the tendencies of the evidence, together with the evidence of the law of Mississippi as to the master's liability for injuries sustained by an employee in his service, will suffice for the consideration and determination of the question which is of chief importance in this case, namely, whether the defendant is liable at all, on the facts presented by this record, for an injury sustained by the plaintiff in the state of Mississippi. 
The only negligence which finds support in any tendency of the evidence, is that of persons whose duty it was to inspect the links of the train, and remove such as were defective, and replace them with others which were not defective. This was the negligence, not of the master, the defendant, but of fellow servants of the plaintiff, for which at common law the defendant is not liable. 
It is, however, further contended that the plaintiff, if his evidence be believed, has made out a case for the recovery sought under the employers' liability act of Alabama, it being clearly shown that there is no such or similar law of force in the state of Mississippi. Considering this position in the abstract,-that is, dissociated from the facts of this particular case, which are supposed to exert an important influence upon it,-there cannot be two opinions as to its being unsound and untenable. So looked at, we do not understand appellee's counsel even to deny either the proposition or its application to this case,-that there can be no recovery in one state for injuries to the person sustained in another, unless the infliction of the injuries is actionable under the law of the state in which they were received. Certainly this is the well-established rule of law, subject, in some jurisdictions, to the qualification that the infliction of the injuries would also support an action in the state where the suit is brought had they been received within that state. 
But it is claimed that the facts of this case take it out of the general rule which the authorities cited above abundantly support, and authorize the courts of Alabama to subject the defendant to the payment of damages under section 2590 of the Code, although the injuries counted on were sustained in Mississippi under circumstances which involved no liability on the defendant by the laws of that state. This insistence is, in the first instance, based on that aspect of the evidence which goes to show that the negligence which produced the casualty transpired in Alabama, and the theory that, wherever the consequences of that negligence manifested itself, a recovery can be had in Alabama. We are referred to no authority in support of this proposition, and exhaustive investigation on our part has failed to disclose any. 
It is admitted, or at least cannot be denied, that negligence of duty unproductive of damnifying results will not authorize or support a recovery. Up to the time this train passed out of Alabama no injury had resulted. For all that occurred in Alabama, therefore, no cause of action whatever arose. The fact which created the right to sue,-the injury,-without which confessedly no action would lie anywhere, transpired in the state of Mississippi. It was in that state, therefore, necessarily that the cause of action, if any, arose; and whether a cause of action arose and existed at all, or not, must in all reason be determined by the law which obtained at the time and place when and where the fact which is relied on to justify a recovery transpired. Section 2590 of the Code of Alabama had no efficacy beyond the lines of Alabama. It cannot be allowed to operate upon facts occurring in another state, so as to evolve out of them rights and liabilities which do not exist under the law of that state, which is of course paramount in the premises. 
Section 2590 of the Code, in other words, is to be interpreted in the light of universally recognized principles of private, international, or interstate law, as if its operation had been expressly limited to this state, and as if its first line read as follows: "When a personal injury is received in Alabama by a servant or employee," etc. The negligent infliction of an injury here, under statutory circumstances, creates a right of action here, which, being transitory, may be enforced in any other state or country the comity of which admits of it; but for an injury inflicted elsewhere than in Alabama our statute gives no right of recovery, and the aggrieved party must look to the local law to ascertain what his rights are. Under that law this plaintiff had no cause of action, as we have seen, and hence he has no rights which our courts can enforce. 
Another consideration it is insisted, entitles this plaintiff to recover here under the employers' liability act for an injury inflicted beyond the territorial operation of that act. This is claimed upon the fact that at the time plaintiff was injured he was in the discharge of duties which rested on him by the terms of a contract between him and the defendant, which had been entered into in Alabama, and hence was an Alabama contract, in connection with the facts that plaintiff was and is a citizen of this state, and the defendant is an Alabama corporation. These latter facts-of citizenship and domicile, respectively, of plaintiff and defendant-are of no importance in this connection, it seems to us, further than this: they may tend to show that the contract was made here, which is not controverted and, if the plaintiff has a cause of action at all, he, by reason of them, may prosecute it in our courts. They have no bearing on the primary question of the existence of a cause of action, and, as that is the question before us, we need not further advert to the fact of plaintiff's citizenship or defendant's domicile.
The contract was that plaintiff should serve the defendant in the capacity of a brakeman on its freight trains between Birmingham, Ala., and Meridian, Miss., and should receive as compensation a stipulated sum for each trip from Birmingham to Meridian and return. The theory is that the employers' liability act became a part of this contract If this argument is sound, and it is sound if the duties and liabilities prescribed by the act can be said to be contractual duties and obligations at all, it would lead to conclusions, the possibility of which has not hitherto been suggested by any court or law writer, and which, to say the least, would be astounding to the profession. 
It is the purpose of the statute, and must be the limit of its operation, to govern persons standing in the relation of master and servants to each other, in respect of their conduct in certain particulars within the state of Alabama. Mississippi has the same right to establish governmental rules for such persons within her borders as Alabama, and she has established rules which are different from those of our law; and the conduct of such persons towards each other is, when its legality is brought in question, to be adjudged by the rules of the one or the other state, as it falls territorially within the one or the other. 
For the error in refusing to instruct the jury to find for the defendant, if they believed the evidence, the judgment is reversed, and the cause will be remanded.
