Once again Negro employees are here under the
Railway Labor Act1 asking that their collective
bargaining agent be compelled to represent them fairly.
In a series of cases beginning with Steele v. Louisville &
Nashville R. Co., 323 U.S. 192, this Court has
emphatically and repeatedly ruled that an exclusive
bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act is
obligated to represent all employees in the bargaining
unit fairly and without discrimination because of race
and has held that the courts have power to protect
employees against such invidious discrimination.2
This class suit was brought in a Federal District Court in
Texas by certain Negro members of the Brotherhood of
Railway and Steamship Clerks, petitioners here, on
behalf of themselves and other Negro employees
similarly situated against the Brotherhood, its Local
Union No. 28 and certain officers of both. In summary,
the complaint [355 U.S. 43] made the following
allegations relevant to our decision: Petitioners were
employees of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad at its
Houston Freight House. Local 28 of the Brotherhood
was the designated bargaining agent under the Railway
Labor Act for the bargaining unit to which petitioners
belonged. A contract existed between the Union and the
Railroad which gave the employees in the bargaining
unit certain protection from discharge and loss of
seniority. In May 1954, the Railroad purported to
abolish 45 jobs held by petitioners or other Negroes all
of whom were either discharged or demoted. In truth
the 45 jobs were not abolished at all but instead filled by
whites as the Negroes were ousted, except for a few
instances where Negroes were rehired to fill their old
jobs but with loss of seniority. Despite repeated pleas by
petitioners, the Union, acting according to plan, did
nothing to protect them against these discriminatory
discharges and refused to give them protection
comparable to that given white employees. The
complaint then went on to allege that the Union had
failed in general to represent Negro employees equally
and in good faith. It charged that such discrimination
constituted a violation of petitioners' right under the
Railway Labor Act to fair representation from their
bargaining agent. And it concluded by asking for relief
in the nature of declaratory judgment, injunction and
damages.
The respondents appeared and moved to dismiss the
complaint on several grounds: (1) the National Railroad
Adjustment Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the
controversy; (2) the Texas and New Orleans Railroad,
which had not been joined, was an indispensable party
defendant; and (3) the complaint failed to state a claim
upon which relief could be given. The District Court
granted the motion to dismiss holding that Congress
had given the Adjustment Board exclusive jurisdiction
over [355 U.S. 44] the controversy. The Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, apparently relying on the
same ground, affirmed. 229 F.2d 436. Since the case
raised an important question concerning the protection
of employee rights under the Railway Labor Act we
granted certiorari. 352 U.S. 818.
We hold that it was error for the courts below to
dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. They took
the position that ยง 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act
conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Adjustment
Board because the case, in their view, involved the
interpretation and application of the collective
bargaining agreement. But ยง 3 First (i) by its own terms
applies only to "disputes between an employee or group
of employees and a carrier or carriers."3 This case
involves no dispute between employee and employer
but to the contrary is a suit by employees against the
bargaining agent to enforce their statutory right not to
be unfairly discriminated against by it in bargaining.4
The Adjustment Board has no power under ยง 3 First (i)
or any other provision of the Act to protect them from
such discrimination. Furthermore, the contract between
the Brotherhood and the Railroad will be, at most, only
incidentally involved in resolving this controversy
between petitioners and their bargaining agent.
Although the District Court did not pass on the other
reasons advanced for dismissal of the complaint we
think it timely and proper for us to consider them here.
They have been briefed and argued by both parties and
the respondents urge that the decision below be upheld,
if necessary, on these other grounds.
As in the courts below, respondents contend that the
Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company is an
indispensable party which the petitioners have failed to
join as a defendant. On the basis of the allegations made
in the complaint and the relief demanded by petitioners
we believe that contention is unjustifiable. We cannot
see how the Railroad's rights or interests will be affected
by this action to enforce the duty of the bargaining
representative to represent petitioners fairly. This is not
a suit, directly or indirectly, against the Railroad. No
relief is asked from it and there is no prospect that any
will or can be granted which will bind it. If an issue does
develop which necessitates joining the Railroad either it
or the respondents will then have an adequate
opportunity to request joinder.
Turning to respondents' final ground, we hold that
under the general principles laid down in the Steele,
Graham, and Howard cases the complaint adequately set
forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. In
appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of
course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be
dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts
[355 U.S. 46] in support of his claim which would entitle
him to relief.5 Here, the complaint alleged, in part, that
petitioners were discharged wrongfully by the Railroad
and that the Union, acting according to plan, refused to
protect their jobs as it did those of white employees or
to help them with their grievances all because they were
Negroes. If these allegations are proven there has been a
manifest breach of the Union's statutory duty to
represent fairly and without hostile discrimination all of
the employees in the bargaining unit. This Court
squarely held in Steele and subsequent cases that
discrimination in representation because of race is
prohibited by the Railway Labor Act. The bargaining
representative's duty not to draw "irrelevant and
invidious"6 distinctions among those it represents does
not come to an abrupt end, as the respondents seem to
contend, with the making of an agreement between
union and employer. Collective bargaining is a
continuing process. Among other things, it involves
day-to-day adjustments in the contract and other
working rules, resolution of new problems not covered
by existing agreements, and the protection of employee
rights already secured by contract. The bargaining
representative can no more unfairly discriminate in
carrying out these functions than it can in negotiating a
collective agreement.7 A contract may be fair and
impartial on its face yet administered in such a way,
with the active or tacit consent of the union, as to be
flagrantly discriminatory against some members of the
bargaining unit.
The respondents point to the fact that under the
Railway Labor Act aggrieved employees can file their
own grievances with the Adjustment Board or sue the
employer for breach of contract. Granting this, it still
furnishes no sanction for the Union's alleged
discrimination in refusing to represent petitioners. The
Railway Labor Act, in an attempt to aid collective action
by employees, conferred great power and protection on
the bargaining agent chosen by a majority of them. As
individuals or small groups the employees cannot begin
to possess the bargaining power of their representative
in negotiating with the employer or in presenting their
grievances to him. Nor may a minority choose another
agent to bargain in their behalf. We need not pass on
the Union's claim that it was not obliged to handle any
grievances at all because we are clear that once it
undertook to bargain or present grievances for some of
the employees it represented it could not refuse to take
similar action in good faith for other employees just
because they were Negroes.
The respondents also argue that the complaint failed to
set forth specific facts to support its general allegations
of discrimination and that its dismissal is therefore
proper. The decisive answer to this is that the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set
out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To
the contrary, all the Rules require is "a short and plain
statement of the claim"8 that will give the defendant fair
notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests. The illustrative forms appended to
the Rules plainly demonstrate this. Such simplified
"notice pleading" is made possible by the liberal
opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial
procedures [355 U.S. 48] established by the Rules to
disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and
defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts
and issues.9 Following the simple guide of Rule 8 (f) that
"all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial
justice," we have no doubt that petitioners' complaint
adequately set forth a claim and gave the respondents
fair notice of its basis. The Federal Rules reject the
approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one
misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and
accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to
facilitate a proper decision on the merits. Cf. Maty v.
Grasselli Chemical Co., 303 U.S. 197.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to
the District Court for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
