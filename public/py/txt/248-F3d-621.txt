The plaintiff brought suit against her employer under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, charging racial
discrimination. The case was tried, the jury returned a
verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals,
arguing that a juror named Leiter should have been
struck for cause. If the plaintiff is right, she is entitled to
a new trial without having to show that Leiter's
presence on the jury caused the jury to side with the
defendant. Denial of the right to an unbiased tribunal is
one of those trial errors that is not excused by being
shown to have been harmless. Gray v. Mississippi, 481
U.S. 648, 668, 107 S.Ct. 2045, 95 L.Ed.2d 622 (1987);
Grancorvitz v. Franklin, 890 F.2d 34, 41 (7th Cir.1989);
Fietzer v. Ford Motor Co., 622 F.2d 281, 286 (7th
Cir.1980); Dyer v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 970, 973 and n. 2
(9th Cir.1998) (en banc).
But what of the plaintiff's failure to use any of her three
peremptory challenges to strike Leiter? She says that she
used up her peremptory challenges on jurors whom she
considered even less likely to favor her cause than Leiter
was. This acknowledgment might seem to imply — since
the plaintiff is not contending that any of those [248
F.3d 623] jurors had to be stricken for cause — that she
can't really think that Leiter was biased; for if Leiter was
biased and those other three were not, surely the
plaintiff would have used a peremptory challenge to get
rid of Leiter first. That doesn't follow. Bias is only one
factor in deciding whether to challenge a juror. A lawyer
might be utterly convinced that a member of the jury
venire would vote against his client no matter what the
evidence showed, and yet his belief might be based on a
hunch that he could not articulate as a ground for a
challenge for cause. He might be more eager to strike
that juror than one who had an evident bias (though the
judge hadn't been convinced of this), for he might think
he could overcome the hurdle posed by that bias more
readily than he could persuade the stubborn but not
demonstrably biased juror.
A plaintiff may have a duty to use a peremptory
challenge to remove a juror whom the judge correctly or
incorrectly has failed to remove for cause, in which
event a plaintiff who fails to use a peremptory challenge
for this purpose will have forfeited the right to appeal
the denial of the challenge for cause. In Ross v.
Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81, 108 S.Ct. 2273, 101 L.Ed.2d 80
(1988), the Supreme Court in a capital-punishment case
upheld against constitutional challenge a state rule
imposing just such a duty. On the basis of Ross we then
held that the loss of a peremptory challenge because the
challenge was used to "cure" the judge's error in failing
to remove a juror challenged for cause did not impair
the right to an impartial tribunal. United States v.
Nururdin, 8 F.3d 1187, 1191 (7th Cir.1993). That
became the law of the nation in United States v.
Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 120 S.Ct. 774, 145
L.Ed.2d 792 (2000); see also United States v. Polichemi,
219 F.3d 698, 705-06 (7th Cir.2000); Walzer v. St.
Joseph State Hospital, 231 F.3d 1108, 1111 (8th
Cir.2000). All but Ross are different cases from the
present one, however. In those cases the peremptory
challenge had been exercised and the biased juror
removed. As a result, the jury that decided the
defendant's guilt was impartial. But could a defendant
preserve the issue of bias simply by failing to use his
peremptory challenge to remove the biased juror? Since
the use of a peremptory challenge to remove that juror
would cure the judge's error, the defendant's failure to
use a peremptory challenge to do this might well be
thought to make the error a self-inflicted wound, as
argued in a concurring opinion in Martinez-Salazar, 528
U.S. at 318-19, 120 S.Ct. 774. The majority opinion,
however, suggests a different view — that the litigant
can let the biased juror be seated and seek to reverse the
adverse judgment (if one results) on appeal on grounds
of bias. See id. at 314-17, 120 S.Ct. 774. The suggestion
is dictum, and can be questioned as putting the litigant
in a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose position: if he wins a
jury verdict, he can pocket his victory, and if he loses, he
can get a new trial.
But this is not the case in which to consider whether to
take on the Supreme Court's dictum, since the defendant
is not arguing that the plaintiff's failure to use a
peremptory challenge against Leiter prevents the
plaintiff from challenging Leiter's presence on the jury.
It argues the distinct point that the plaintiff cannot
complain about a violation of her statutory right to
three peremptory challenges. 28 U.S.C. § 1870; see also
Fed.R.Civ.P. 47(b). The defendant is of course right.
Martinez-Salazar states that securing an impartial jury is
one of the intended uses of peremptory challenges, 528
U.S. at 316, 120 S.Ct. 774; see also Walzer v. St. Joseph
State Hospital, supra, 231 F.3d at 1111; United States v.
Quinn, 230 F.3d 862, 865 (6th Cir.2000), and hence may
be [248 F.3d 624] a reason why the statutory allotment is
three rather than one or two or none. (Martinez-Salazar
was a criminal case, but we cannot think of any
difference which that would make.) But the statutory
question is a side issue. The important question is
whether the plaintiff's constitutional right to an
impartial tribunal was infringed. Let us see.
During the voir dire of the jury, the judge asked the
members of the venire whether "there is something
about this kind of lawsuit for money damages that
would start any of you leaning for or against a particular
party?" Leiter raised her hand and explained that she has
"been an owner of a couple of businesses and am
currently an owner of a business, and I feel that as an
employer and owner of a business that will definitely
sway my judgment in this case." The judge asked her
whether "if I instructed you as to what the law is that
you would be able to apply the law recognizing that you
are a business owner?" To which she replied, "I think
my experience will cloud my judgment, but I can do my
best." The judge permitted the lawyers also to ask
questions of the prospective jurors and Thompson's
lawyer asked Leiter, "And you said earlier that you were
concerned that your position as a business owner may
cloud your judgment. Can you tell me how?" And she
replied, "I am constantly faced with people that want
various benefits or different positions in the company
[what Thompson was seeking from her employer, the
defendant, Altheimer & Gray] or better contacts or, you
know, a myriad of issues that employers face on a
regular basis, and I have to decide whether or not that
person should get them." The lawyer then asked Leiter
whether she was concerned "that if somebody doesn't
get them [benefits sought from their employer] they're
going to sue you," and she answered, "Of course." Asked
then whether "you believe that people file lawsuits just
because they don't get something they want?", she
answered, "I believe there are some people that do." In
answer to the next and last question, "Are you
concerned that that might cloud your judgment in this
case?" she said, "I think I bring a lot of background to
this case, and I can't say that it's not going to cloud my
judgment. I can try to be as fair as I can, as I do every
day."
That was the end of the voir dire of Leiter. After
refusing to strike her for cause (though urged to do so
by the plaintiff's lawyer), and releasing the jurors who
had not been selected for the jury (the defendant had
also exercised its three peremptory challenges, none
overlapping with the plaintiff's), the judge asked the
eight remaining jurors, that is, the jurors selected to
hear the case, whether they would follow his
instructions on the law even if they didn't agree with
them and whether they would be able to suspend
judgment until they had heard all the evidence. The
question was asked to the jurors at large and all either
nodded their heads or said yes. The defendant, again
perhaps dropping the ball, makes nothing of Leiter's
failure at this stage to reiterate her doubts about her
ability to exercise an unclouded judgment. The
defendant is content to argue that the answers that
Leiter gave to the earlier questions by the judge, and the
questions by Thompson's lawyer, did not require that
Leiter be struck for cause.
Our review of the trial judge's ruling with respect to a
challenge for cause is deferential, Salvato v. Illinois
Dept. of Human Rights, 155 F.3d 922, 927 (7th Cir.
1998); Pitsonbarger v. Gramley, 141 F.3d 728, 734-35
(7th Cir.1998); United States v. Vega, 72 F.3d 507, 512
(7th Cir.1995); United States v. Blom, 242 F.3d 799, 805
(8th Cir.2001); United States v. Beasley, 48 F.3d 262,
266 (7th Cir.1995); Wolfe v. Brigano, 232 F.3d 499, 502
(6th Cir.2000),[248 F.3d 625] but not completely supine,
and it is pertinent to note that no issue of credibility is
presented. There is no argument that Leiter was not
telling the truth. The issue is interpretive: did what she
say manifest a degree of bias such that the judge abused
his discretion in failing to strike her for cause?
In defense of his ruling, the defendant has come up with
only one case, United States v. Ricketts, 146 F.3d 492,
496 (7th Cir. 1998), where we upheld the trial judge's
refusal to strike for cause jurors who, in a trial for
complicity in a prison riot, said on voir dire that they
would tend to believe prison guards over inmates. The
defendant says in its brief that we did this even though
the jurors in question "never testified to their
willingness or capacity to put this tendency aside for the
purposes of trial." That is an inaccurate description of
our decision, and leaves the defendant startlingly bereft
of apposite case law. The trial judge in Ricketts had
faulted defense counsel for failing to follow up the
question about the juror's tendency to believe guards
over inmates, and as a result of that failure the jurors
had never had a chance to affirm their willingness or
capacity to judge impartially. The tendency was not
itself a sign of bias. There is a critical difference between
a "prior [belief]" in the Bayesian statistician's sense and
"bias" in the sense that requires disqualification of a
juror or judge. Everyone brings to a case a set of beliefs
that may incline him in one direction or another. A
person told that X had been indicted, and asked whether
he thought X guilty, might reply that he thought X
probably was guilty because few innocent people are
indicted. That would be a prior. It would be a bias only
if it were irrational or unshakable, so that the
prospective juror "would be unable to faithfully and
impartially apply the law," Wainwright v. Witt, 469
U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)
(emphasis added), would be, in other words, "adamant,"
Fleenor v. Anderson, 171 F.3d 1096, 1099 (7th Cir.1999)
— in our hypothetical if, for example, the person added,
"Nothing will ever convince me that the government
would indict an innocent person." Cf. Ross v.
Oklahoma, supra, 487 U.S. at 83-84, 108 S.Ct. 2273.
When Leiter said that she believed that some people sue
their employer just because they haven't gotten a
promotion or a raise or some other benefit, she was not
manifesting bias. She was expressing a prior belief
(prior, that is, to hearing any evidence in this case) that
was not only not irrational, but was undoubtedly true —
there are indeed some people who will sue their
employer just because of disappointment over the
failure of the employer to give them something they
want. In other words, there are spurious suits, in the
employment domain as elsewhere. Leiter could not be
thought biased for holding a true belief, or even for
holding it unshakably if it is indubitably true. The belief
that some employees make bogus claims against
employers is so obviously true that it could not be
shaken; but inability to set aside a clearly sound belief
does not make for a biased juror. It makes for a realistic
one.
Suppose a member of the venire in a case involving
alleged sex discrimination by a fire department stated his
belief that men on average have greater upper-body
strength than women. Suppose he added that this belief
was unshakable in the sense that if some social scientist
testified otherwise, he would conclude that he was being
fed junk science. Should this juror be disqualified? Not
automatically, surely. The relevant questions would be
whether he could distinguish averages from individuals,
[248 F.3d 626] and thus recognize the possibility that a
given woman might have greater upper-body strength
than a given man, and whether he was so fixated on the
average sex difference in upper-body strength that he
was not open to the possibility that a woman whose
upper-body strength was indeed less than that of the
least strong firefighter in the fire department could
nevertheless be as good a firefighter, or even a better
one.
The question in this case was not whether Leiter's belief
that some claims against employers are spurious was
true or false (it was, as we have noted, true), but
whether this belief would somehow impede her in
giving due weight to the evidence and following the
judge's instructions. That question was not adequately
explored. The last thing Leiter said before the judge
refused to strike her for cause was that she couldn't say
the "background" she brought to this case wasn't going
to "cloud" her judgment. She said she would try to be
fair, but she expressed no confidence in being able to
succeed in the attempt. She may have realized that
because of bad experiences in the past, she might have
difficulty separating the logically distinct propositions
that some claims against employers are bogus and that
this claim must be bogus because it is a claim against an
employer.
Had she said she could not be fair, the judge would of
course have had to strike her for cause. She did not say
that, and so the judge (the defendant, though citing
Ricketts, does not argue that the plaintiff's lawyer was at
fault in failing to follow up his question whether Leiter's
background would cloud her judgment) should have
followed up by asking her, as he later asked the jury en
masse, whether she would follow his instructions on the
law and suspend judgment until she had heard all the
evidence.
Instead the matter was left dangling, just as it had been
in Martinez-Salazar. That juror whom the defendant in
that case used a peremptory challenge to excuse after the
judge refused to excuse him for cause, when asked
"whether, if he were a defendant facing jurors with
backgrounds and opinions similar to his own, he
thought he would get a fair trial," answered: "I think
that's a difficult question. I don't think I know the
answer to that." 528 U.S. at 308, 120 S.Ct. 774 (emphasis
added). And when asked whether he "would feel more
comfortable erring on the side of the prosecution or the
defense," he said he "would probably be more favorable
to the prosecution." Id. (emphasis added). When the
judge then scolded him for reversing the presumption of
innocence, the juror said, "I understand that in theory."
Id. (emphasis added). The judge nevertheless refused to
excuse the juror for cause because "he said ... he could
follow the instructions, and he said ... `I don't think I
know what I would do,' et cetera." Id. at 309, 120 S.Ct.
774. The Supreme Court held that in these
circumstances the judge had erred in not allowing the
challenge for cause. It is just like our case. The judge
didn't push hard enough to determine whether Leiter
could relinquish her prior beliefs for purposes of
deciding the case.
Had the judge pushed Leiter and had she finally given
unequivocal assurances that he deemed credible, his
ruling could not be disturbed. See Lockett v. Ohio, 438
U.S. 586, 595-96, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978);
Salvato v. Illinois Dept. of Human Rights, supra, 155
F.3d at 926-27; Pitsonbarger v. Gramley, supra, 141 F.3d
at 735; Art Press, Ltd. v. Western Printing Machinery
Co., 791 F.2d 616, 619 (7th Cir.1986); United States v.
Blom, supra, 242 F.3d at 805. But he failed to do that.
The venire contained 20 prospective jurors, [248 F.3d
627] and more than enough were left to make up a full
jury of 8 when he refused to excuse her. A candid and
thoughtful person, if one may judge from the transcript,
Leiter would probably have made an excellent juror —
in another case.
When a prospective juror manifests a prior belief that is
both material and contestable (for, to repeat an earlier
point, it is not bias to cling to a belief that no rational
person would question), it is the judge's duty to
determine whether the juror is capable of suspending
that belief for the duration of the trial. When as in this
case the record contains no assurances that the belief is
"shakable," that the prospective juror can exercise a
judgment unclouded by that belief, the verdict cannot
stand. See Art Press, Ltd. v. Western Printing
Machinery Co., supra, 791 F.2d at 619; Wolfe v.
Brigano, supra, 232 F.3d at 502-03; United States v.
Gonzalez, 214 F.3d 1109, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2000);
United States v. Padilla-Mendoza, 157 F.3d 730, 733-34
(9th Cir.1998); United States v. Salamone, 800 F.2d
1216, 1226-27 (3d Cir. 1986). "When a juror is unable to
state that she will serve fairly and impartially despite
being asked repeatedly for such assurances, we can have
no confidence that the juror will `lay aside' her biases or
her prejudicial personal experiences and render a fair
and impartial verdict." United States v. Gonzalez, supra,
214 F.3d at 1114. That's this case. Missing are those
"unwavering affirmations of impartiality" that permitted
the district judge in United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d
648, 653 (2d Cir.1991), to find the challenged juror
unbiased.
REVERSED AND REMANDED.
