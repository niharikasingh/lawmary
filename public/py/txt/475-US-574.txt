This case requires that we again consider the standard
district courts must apply when deciding whether to
grant summary judgment in an antitrust conspiracy case.
I
Stating the facts of this case is a daunting task. The
opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
runs to 69 pages; the primary opinion of the District
Court is more than three times as long. In re Japanese
Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 238
(CA3 1983);[475 U.S. 577] 513 F.Supp. 1100 (ED Pa.
1981). Two respected District Judges each have
authored a number of opinions in this case; the
published ones alone would fill an entire volume of the
Federal Supplement. In addition, the parties have filed a
40-volume appendix in this Court that is said to contain
the essence of the evidence on which the District Court
and the Court of Appeals based their respective
decisions.
We will not repeat what these many opinions have
stated and restated, or summarize the mass of
documents that constitute the record on appeal. Since
we review only the standard applied by the Court of
Appeals in deciding this case, and not the weight
assigned to particular pieces of evidence, we find it
unnecessary to state the facts in great detail. What
follows is a summary of this case's long history.
A
Petitioners, defendants below, are 21 corporations that
manufacture or sell "consumer electronic products"
(CEPs) — for the most part, television sets. Petitioners
include both Japanese manufacturers of CEPs and
American firms, controlled by Japanese parents, that sell
the Japanese-manufactured products. Respondents,
plaintiffs below, are Zenith Radio Corporation (Zenith)
and National Union Electric Corporation (NUE). Zenith
is an American firm that manufactures and sells
television sets. NUE is the corporate successor to
Emerson Radio Company, an American firm that
manufactured and sold television sets until 1970, when
it withdrew from the market after sustaining substantial
losses. Zenith and NUE began this lawsuit in 1974,1
claiming that petitioners had illegally conspired to drive
[475 U.S. 578] American firms from the American CEP
market. According to respondents, the gist of this
conspiracy was a " `scheme to raise, fix and maintain
artificially high prices for television receivers sold by
[petitioners] in Japan and, at the same time, to fix and
maintain low prices for television receivers exported to
and sold in the United States.' " 723 F. 2d, at 251
(quoting respondents' preliminary pretrial
memorandum). These "low prices" were allegedly at
levels that produced substantial losses for petitioners.
513 F. Supp., at 1125. The conspiracy allegedly began as
early as 1953, and according to respondents was in full
operation by sometime in the late 1960's. Respondents
claimed that various portions of this scheme violated §§
1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, § 2(a) of the RobinsonPatman
Act, § 73 of the Wilson Tariff Act, and the
Antidumping Act of 1916.
After several years of detailed discovery, petitioners filed
motions for summary judgment on all claims against
them. The District Court directed the parties to file,
with preclusive effect, "Final Pretrial Statements" listing
all the documentary evidence that would be offered if
the case proceeded to trial. Respondents filed such a
statement, and petitioners responded with a series of
motions challenging the admissibility of respondents'
evidence. In three detailed opinions, the District Court
found the bulk of the evidence on which Zenith and
NUE relied inadmissible.2
The District Court then turned to petitioners' motions
for summary judgment. In an opinion spanning 217
pages, the court found that the admissible evidence did
not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the
existence of the alleged [475 U.S. 579] conspiracy. At
bottom, the court found, respondents' claims rested on
the inferences that could be drawn from petitioners'
parallel conduct in the Japanese and American markets,
and from the effects of that conduct on petitioners'
American competitors. 513 F. Supp., at 1125-1127.
After reviewing the evidence both by category and in
toto, the court found that any inference of conspiracy
was unreasonable, because (i) some portions of the
evidence suggested that petitioners conspired in ways
that did not injure respondents, and (ii) the evidence
that bore directly on the alleged price-cutting conspiracy
did not rebut the more plausible inference that
petitioners were cutting prices to compete in the
American market and not to monopolize it. Summary
judgment therefore was granted on respondents' claims
under § 1 of the Sherman Act and the Wilson Tariff
Act. Because the Sherman Act § 2 claims, which alleged
that petitioners had combined to monopolize the
American CEP market, were functionally
indistinguishable from the § 1 claims, the court
dismissed them also. Finally, the court found that the
Robinson-Patman Act claims depended on the same
supposed conspiracy as the Sherman Act claims. Since
the court had found no genuine issue of fact as to the
conspiracy, it entered judgment in petitioners' favor on
those claims as well.3
[475 U.S. 580] B
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.4
The court began by examining the District Court's
evidentiary rulings, and determined that much of the
evidence excluded by the District Court was in fact
admissible. 723 F. 2d, at 260-303. These evidentiary
rulings are not before us. See 471 U.S. 1002 (1985)
(limiting grant of certiorari).
On the merits, and based on the newly enlarged record,
the court found that the District Court's summary
judgment decision was improper. The court
acknowledged that "there are legal limitations upon the
inferences which may be drawn from circumstantial
evidence," 723 F. 2d, at 304, but it found that "the legal
problem . . . is different" when "there is direct evidence
of concert of action." Ibid. Here, the court concluded,
"there is both direct evidence of certain kinds of concert
of action and circumstantial evidence having some
tendency to suggest that other kinds of concert of action
may have occurred." Id., at 304-305. Thus, the court
reasoned, cases concerning the limitations on inferring
conspiracy from ambiguous evidence were not
dispositive. Id., at 305. Turning to the evidence, the
court determined that a factfinder reasonably could
draw the following conclusions:
1. The Japanese market for CEPs was characterized by oligopolistic
behavior, with a small number of producers meeting regularly and
exchanging information on price and other matters. Id., at 307.
This created the opportunity for a stable combination to raise both
prices and profits in Japan. American firms could not attack such a
combination because the Japanese Government imposed significant
barriers to entry. Ibid.
2. Petitioners had relatively higher fixed costs than their American
counterparts, and therefore needed to [475 U.S. 581] operate at
something approaching full capacity in order to make a profit. Ibid.
3. Petitioners' plant capacity exceeded the needs of the Japanese
market. Ibid.
4. By formal agreements arranged in cooperation with Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), petitioners
fixed minimum prices for CEPs exported to the American market.
Id., at 310. The parties refer to these prices as the "check prices,"
and to the agreements that require them as the "check price
agreements."
5. Petitioners agreed to distribute their products in the United
States according to a "five company rule": each Japanese producer
was permitted to sell only to five American distributors. Ibid.
6. Petitioners undercut their own check prices by a variety of rebate
schemes. Id., at 311. Petitioners sought to conceal these rebate
schemes both from the United States Customs Service and from
MITI, the former to avoid various customs regulations as well as
action under the antidumping laws, and the latter to cover up
petitioners' violations of the check-price agreements.
Based on inferences from the foregoing conclusions,5
the Court of Appeals concluded that a reasonable
factfinder could find a conspiracy to depress prices in
the American market in order to drive out American
competitors, which conspiracy was funded by excess
profits obtained in the Japanese market. The court
apparently did not consider whether it was as plausible
to conclude that petitioners' price-cutting behavior was
independent and not conspiratorial.
[475 U.S. 582] The court found it unnecessary to address
petitioners' claim that they could not be held liable
under the antitrust laws for conduct that was compelled
by a foreign sovereign. The claim, in essence, was that
because MITI required petitioners to enter into the
check-price agreements, liability could not be premised
on those agreements. The court concluded that this case
did not present any issue of sovereign compulsion,
because the check-price agreements were being used as
"evidence of a low export price conspiracy" and not as
an independent basis for finding antitrust liability. The
court also believed it was unclear that the check prices in
fact were mandated by the Japanese Government,
notwithstanding a statement to that effect by MITI
itself. Id., at 315.
We granted certiorari to determine (i) whether the
Court of Appeals applied the proper standards in
evaluating the District Court's decision to grant
petitioners' motion for summary judgment, and (ii)
whether petitioners could be held liable under the
antitrust laws for a conspiracy in part compelled by a
foreign sovereign. 471 U.S. 1002 (1985). We reverse on
the first issue, but do not reach the second.
II
We begin by emphasizing what respondents' claim is
not. Respondents cannot recover antitrust damages
based solely on an alleged cartelization of the Japanese
market, because American antitrust laws do not regulate
the competitive conditions of other nations' economies.
United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d
416, 443 (CA2 1945) (L. Hand, J.); 1 P. Areeda & D.
Turner, Antitrust Law ¶ 236d (1978).6 Nor can
respondents recover damages for [475 U.S. 583] any
conspiracy by petitioners to charge higher than
competitive prices in the American market. Such
conduct would indeed violate the Sherman Act, United
States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392 (1927);
United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150,
223 (1940), but it could not injure respondents: as
petitioners' competitors, respondents stand to gain from
any conspiracy to raise the market price in CEPs. Cf.
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S.
477, 488-489 (1977). Finally, for the same reason,
respondents cannot recover for a conspiracy to impose
non-price restraints that have the effect of either raising
market price or limiting output. Such restrictions,
though harmful to competition, actually benefit
competitors by making supra-competitive pricing more
attractive. Thus, neither petitioners' alleged
supracompetitive pricing in Japan, nor the five company
rule that limited distribution in this country, nor the
check prices insofar as they established minimum prices
in this country, can by themselves give respondents a
cognizable claim against petitioners for antitrust
damages. The Court of Appeals therefore erred to the
extent that it found evidence of these alleged
conspiracies to be "direct evidence" of a conspiracy that
injured respondents. See 723 F. 2d, at 304-305.
[475 U.S. 584] Respondents nevertheless argue that
these supposed conspiracies, if not themselves grounds
for recovery of antitrust damages, are circumstantial
evidence of another conspiracy that is cognizable: a
conspiracy to monopolize the American market by
means of pricing below the market level.7 The thrust of
respondents' argument is that petitioners used their
monopoly profits from the Japanese market to fund a
concerted campaign to price predatorily and thereby
drive respondents and other American manufacturers of
CEPs out of business. Once successful, according to
respondents, petitioners would cartelize the American
CEP market, restricting output and raising prices above
the level that fair competition would produce. The
resulting monopoly profits, respondents contend, would
more than compensate petitioners for the losses they
incurred through years of pricing below market level.
The Court of Appeals found that respondents' allegation
of a horizontal conspiracy to engage in predatory
pricing,8 [475 U.S. 585] if proved,9 would be a per se
violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 723 F. 2d, at 306.
Petitioners did not appeal from that conclusion. The
issue in this case thus becomes whether respondents
adduced sufficient evidence in support of their theory to
survive summary judgment. We therefore examine the
principles that govern the summary judgment
determination.
III
To survive petitioners' motion for summary judgment,10
respondents must establish that there is a genuine issue
of material fact as to whether petitioners entered into an
illegal conspiracy that caused respondents to suffer a
cognizable injury. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e);11 First
National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S.
253, 288-289 (1968). This showing has two
components. First, respondents must show more than a
conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws; they must
show an injury to them resulting from the illegal
conduct. Respondents charge petitioners with a whole
host of conspiracies in restraint of trade. Supra, at 582-
583. Except for the alleged conspiracy to monopolize the
American market through predatory pricing, these
alleged conspiracies could not have caused respondents
to suffer an "antitrust injury," Brunswick Corp. v.
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S., at 489, because they
actually tended to benefit respondents. Supra, at 582-
583. Therefore, unless, in context, evidence of these
"other" conspiracies raises a genuine issue concerning
the existence of a predatory pricing conspiracy, that
evidence cannot defeat petitioners' summary judgment
motion.
Second, the issue of fact must be "genuine." Fed. Rules
Civ. Proc. 56(c), (e). When the moving party has carried
its burden under Rule 56(c),12 its opponent must do
more than simply show that there is some metaphysical
doubt as to the material facts. See DeLuca v. Atlantic
Refining Co., 176 F.2d 421, 423 (CA2 1949) (L. Hand,
J.), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 943 (1950); 10A C. Wright, A.
Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §
2727 (1983); Clark, Special Problems in Drafting and
Interpreting Procedural Codes and Rules, 3 Vand. L.
Rev. 493, 504-505 (1950). Cf. Sartor v. Arkansas Natural
Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 627 (1944). In the language of
the Rule, the nonmoving party must come forward with
"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for
trial." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e) (emphasis added). See
also Advisory Committee Note to 1963 Amendment of
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 626
(purpose of summary judgment is to "pierce the
pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether
there is a genuine need for trial"). Where the record
taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to
find for the non-moving party, there is no "genuine
issue for trial." Cities Service, supra, at 289.
It follows from these settled principles that if the factual
context renders respondents' claim implausible — if the
claim is one that simply makes no economic sense —
respondents must come forward with more persuasive
evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be
necessary. Cities Service is instructive. The issue in that
case was whether proof of the defendant's refusal to deal
with the plaintiff supported an inference that the
defendant willingly had joined an illegal boycott.
Economic factors strongly suggested that the defendant
had no motive to join the alleged conspiracy. 391 U. S.,
at 278-279. The Court acknowledged that, in isolation,
the defendant's refusal to deal might well have sufficed
to create a triable issue. Id., at 277. But the refusal to deal
had to be evaluated in its factual context. Since the
defendant lacked any rational motive to join the alleged
boycott, and since its refusal to deal was consistent with
the defendant's independent interest, the refusal to deal
could not by itself support a finding of antitrust liability.
Id., at 280.
Respondents correctly note that "[o]n summary
judgment the inferences to be drawn from the
underlying facts . . . must be viewed in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion." United
States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962).[475
U.S. 588] But antitrust law limits the range of
permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1
case. Thus, in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service
Corp., 465 U.S. 752 (1984), we held that conduct as
consistent with permissible competition as with illegal
conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an
inference of antitrust conspiracy. Id., at 764. See also
Cities Service, supra, at 280. To survive a motion for
summary judgment or for a directed verdict, a plaintiff
seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must present
evidence "that tends to exclude the possibility" that the
alleged conspirators acted independently. 465 U. S., at
764. Respondents in this case, in other words, must
show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in
light of the competing inferences of independent action
or collusive action that could not have harmed
respondents. See Cities Service, supra, at 280.
Petitioners argue that these principles apply fully to this
case. According to petitioners, the alleged conspiracy is
one that is economically irrational and practically
infeasible. Consequently, petitioners contend, they had
no motive to engage in the alleged predatory pricing
conspiracy; indeed, they had a strong motive not to
conspire in the manner respondents allege. Petitioners
argue that, in light of the absence of any apparent
motive and the ambiguous nature of the evidence of
conspiracy, no trier of fact reasonably could find that the
conspiracy with which petitioners are charged actually
existed. This argument requires us to consider the
nature of the alleged conspiracy and the practical
obstacles to its implementation.
IV
A
A predatory pricing conspiracy is by nature speculative.
Any agreement to price below the competitive level
requires the conspirators to forgo profits that free
competition would offer them. The forgone profits may
be considered an investment in the future. For the
investment to be rational, [475 U.S. 589] the
conspirators must have a reasonable expectation of
recovering, in the form of later monopoly profits, more
than the losses suffered. As then-Professor Bork,
discussing predatory pricing by a single firm, explained:
"Any realistic theory of predation recognizes that the predator as
well as his victims will incur losses during the fighting, but such a
theory supposes it may be a rational calculation for the predator to
view the losses as an investment in future monopoly profits (where
rivals are to be killed) or in future undisturbed profits (where rivals
are to be disciplined). The future flow of profits, appropriately
discounted, must then exceed the present size of the losses." R.
Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 145 (1978).
See also McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 23 J. Law
& Econ. 289, 295-297 (1980). As this explanation shows,
the success of such schemes is inherently uncertain: the
short-run loss is definite, but the long-run gain depends
on successfully neutralizing the competition. Moreover,
it is not enough simply to achieve monopoly power, as
monopoly pricing may breed quick entry by new
competitors eager to share in the excess profits. The
success of any predatory scheme depends on
maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to
recoup the predator's losses and to harvest some
additional gain. Absent some assurance that the hopedfor
monopoly will materialize, and that it can be
sustained for a significant period of time, "[t]he predator
must make a substantial investment with no assurance
that it will pay off." Easter-brook, Predatory Strategies
and Counterstrategies, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263, 268
(1981). For this reason, there is a consensus among
commentators that predatory pricing schemes are rarely
tried, and even more rarely successful. See, e. g., Bork,
supra, at 149-155; Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing
and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman
Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 699 (1975); Easterbrook,
supra; Koller, The Myth of Predatory Pricing — An
Empirical Study, [475 U.S. 590] 4 Antitrust Law & Econ.
Rev. 105 (1971); McGee, Predatory Price Cutting: The
Standard Oil (N. J.) Case, 1 J. Law & Econ. 137 (1958);
McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 23 J. Law & Econ.,
at 292-294. See also Northeastern Telephone Co. v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, 88
(CA2 1981) ("[N]owhere in the recent outpouring of
literature on the subject do commentators suggest that
[predatory] pricing is either common or likely to
increase"), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943 (1982).
These observations apply even to predatory pricing by a
single firm seeking monopoly power. In this case,
respondents allege that a large number of firms have
conspired over a period of many years to charge belowmarket
prices in order to stifle competition. Such a
conspiracy is incalculably more difficult to execute than
an analogous plan undertaken by a single predator. The
conspirators must allocate the losses to be sustained
during the conspiracy's operation, and must also allocate
any gains to be realized from its success. Precisely
because success is speculative and depends on a
willingness to endure losses for an indefinite period,
each conspirator has a strong incentive to cheat, letting
its partners suffer the losses necessary to destroy the
competition while sharing in any gains if the conspiracy
succeeds. The necessary allocation is therefore difficult
to accomplish. Yet if conspirators cheat to any
substantial extent, the conspiracy must fail, because its
success depends on depressing the market price for all
buyers of CEPs. If there are too few goods at the
artificially low price to satisfy demand, the would-be
victims of the conspiracy can continue to sell at the
"real" market price, and the conspirators suffer losses to
little purpose.
Finally, if predatory pricing conspiracies are generally
unlikely to occur, they are especially so where, as here,
the prospects of attaining monopoly power seem slight.
In order to recoup their losses, petitioners must obtain
enough market power to set higher than competitive
prices, and then must sustain those prices long enough
to earn in excess profits [475 U.S. 591] its what they
earlier gave up in below-cost prices. See Northeastern
Telephone Co. v. American Telephone & Telegraph
Co., supra, at 89; Areeda & Turner, 88 Harv. L. Rev., at
698. Two decades after their conspiracy is alleged to
have commenced,13 petitioners appear to be far from
achieving this goal: the two largest shares of the retail
market in television sets are held by RCA and
respondent Zenith, not by any of petitioners. 6 App. to
Brief for Appellant in No. 81-2331 (CA3), pp. 2575a-
2576a. Moreover, those shares, which together
approximate 40% of sales, did not decline appreciably
during the 1970's. Ibid. Petitioners' collective share rose
rapidly during this period, from one-fifth or less of the
relevant markets to close to 50%. 723 F. 2d, at 316.14
Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals
found, however, that petitioners' share presently allows
them to charge monopoly prices; to the contrary,
respondents contend that the conspiracy is ongoing —
that petitioners are still artificially depressing the market
price in order to drive Zenith out of the market. The
data in the record strongly suggest that that goal is yet
far distant.15
[475 U.S. 592] The alleged conspiracy's failure to achieve
its ends in the two decades of its asserted operation is
strong evidence that the conspiracy does not in fact
exist. Since the losses in such a conspiracy accrue before
the gains, they must be "repaid" with interest. And
because the alleged losses have accrued over the course
of two decades, the conspirators could well require a
correspondingly long time to recoup. Maintaining
supracompetitive prices in turn depends on the
continued cooperation of the conspirators, on the
inability of other would-be competitors to enter the
market, and (not incidentally) on the conspirators'
ability to escape antitrust liability for their minimum
price-fixing cartel.16 Each of these factors weighs more
heavily as the time needed to recoup losses grows. If the
losses have been substantial — as would likely be
necessary [475 U.S. 593] in order to drive out the
competition17 — petitioners would most likely have to
sustain their cartel for years simply to break even.
Nor does the possibility that petitioners have obtained
supracompetitive profits in the Japanese market change
this calculation. Whether or not petitioners have the
means to sustain substantial losses in this country over a
long period of time, they have no motive to sustain such
losses absent some strong likelihood that the alleged
conspiracy in this country will eventually pay off. The
courts below found no evidence of any such success, and
— as indicated above — the facts actually are to the
contrary: RCA and Zenith, not any of the petitioners,
continue to hold the largest share of the American retail
market in color television sets. More important, there is
nothing to suggest any relationship between petitioners'
profits in Japan and the amount petitioners could expect
to gain from a conspiracy to monopolize the American
market. In the absence of any such evidence, the possible
existence of supracompetitive profits in Japan simply
cannot overcome the economic obstacles to the ultimate
success of this alleged predatory conspiracy.18
B
In Monsanto, we emphasized that courts should not
permit factfinders to infer conspiracies when such
inferences are implausible, because the effect of such
practices is often to deter procompetitive conduct.
Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762-764. [475 U.S. 594]
Respondents, petitioners' competitors, seek to hold
petitioners liable for damages caused by the alleged
conspiracy to cut prices. Moreover, they seek to
establish this conspiracy indirectly, through evidence of
other combinations (such as the check-price agreements
and the five company rule) whose natural tendency is to
raise prices, and through evidence of rebates and other
price-cutting activities that respondents argue tend to
prove a combination to suppress prices.19 But cutting
prices in order to increase business often is the very
essence of competition. Thus, mistaken inferences in
cases such as this one are especially costly, because they
chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to
protect. See Monsanto, supra, at 763-764. "[W]e must
be concerned lest a rule or precedent that authorizes a
search for a particular type of undesirable pricing
behavior end up by discouraging legitimate price
competition." Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell
Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 234 (CA1 1983).
In most cases, this concern must be balanced against the
desire that illegal conspiracies be identified and
punished. That balance is, however, unusually one-sided
in cases such as this one. As we earlier explained, supra,
at 588-593, predatory pricing schemes require
conspirators to suffer losses in order eventually to
realize their illegal gains; moreover, the [475 U.S. 595]
gains depend on a host of uncertainties, making such
schemes more likely to fail than to succeed. These
economic realities tend to make predatory pricing
conspiracies self-deterring: unlike most other conduct
that violates the antitrust laws, failed predatory pricing
schemes are costly to the conspirators. See Easterbrook,
The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. Rev. 1, 26 (1984).
Finally, unlike predatory pricing by a single firm,
successful predatory pricing conspiracies involving a
large number of firms can be identified and punished
once they succeed, since some form of minimum pricefixing
agreement would be necessary in order to reap
the benefits of predation. Thus, there is little reason to
be concerned that by granting summary judgment in
cases where the evidence of conspiracy is speculative or
ambiguous, courts will encourage such conspiracies.
V
As our discussion in Part IV-A shows, petitioners had
no motive to enter into the alleged conspiracy. To the
contrary, as presumably rational businesses, petitioners
had every incentive not to engage in the conduct with
which they are charged, for its likely effect would be to
generate losses for petitioners with no corresponding
gains. Cf. Cities Service, 391 U. S., at 279. The Court of
Appeals did not take account of the absence of a
plausible motive to enter into the alleged predatory
pricing conspiracy. It focused instead on whether there
was "direct evidence of concert of action." 723 F. 2d, at
304. The Court of Appeals erred in two respects: (i) the
"direct evidence" on which the court relied had little, if
any, relevance to the alleged predatory pricing
conspiracy; and (ii) the court failed to consider the
absence of a plausible motive to engage in predatory
pricing.
The "direct evidence" on which the court relied was
evidence of other combinations, not of a predatory
pricing conspiracy. Evidence that petitioners conspired
to raise prices in Japan provides little, if any, support for
respondents' [475 U.S. 596] claims: a conspiracy to
increase profits in one market does not tend to show a
conspiracy to sustain losses in another. Evidence that
petitioners agreed to fix minimum prices (through the
check-price agreements) for the American market
actually works in petitioners' favor, because it suggests
that petitioners were seeking to place a floor under
prices rather than to lower them. The same is true of
evidence that petitioners agreed to limit the number of
distributors of their products in the American market —
the so-called five company rule. That practice may have
facilitated a horizontal territorial allocation, see United
States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596 (1972), but
its natural effect would be to raise market prices rather
than reduce them.20 Evidence that tends to support any
of these collateral conspiracies thus says little, if
anything, about the existence of a conspiracy to charge
below-market prices in the American market over a
period of two decades.
That being the case, the absence of any plausible motive
to engage in the conduct charged is highly relevant to
whether a "genuine issue for trial" exists within the
meaning of Rule 56(e). Lack of motive bears on the
range of permissible conclusions that might be drawn
from ambiguous evidence: if petitioners had no rational
economic motive to conspire, and if their conduct is
consistent with other, equally plausible explanations,
[475 U.S. 597] the conduct does not give rise to an
inference of conspiracy. See Cities Service, supra, at
278-280. Here, the conduct in question consists largely
of (i) pricing at levels that succeeded in taking business
away from respondents, and (ii) arrangements that may
have limited petitioners' ability to compete with each
other (and thus kept prices from going even lower).
This conduct suggests either that petitioners behaved
competitively, or that petitioners conspired to raise
prices. Neither possibility is consistent with an
agreement among 21 companies to price below market
levels. Moreover, the predatory pricing scheme that this
conduct is said to prove is one that makes no practical
sense: it calls for petitioners to destroy companies larger
and better established than themselves, a goal that
remains far distant more than two decades after the
conspiracy's birth. Even had they succeeded in obtaining
their monopoly, there is nothing in the record to
suggest that they could recover the losses they would
need to sustain along the way. In sum, in light of the
absence of any rational motive to conspire, neither
petitioners' pricing practices, nor their conduct in the
Japanese market, nor their agreements respecting prices
and distribution in the American market, suffice to
create a "genuine issue for trial." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.

On remand, the Court of Appeals is free to consider
whether there is other evidence that is sufficiently
unambiguous to permit a trier of fact to find that
petitioners conspired to price predatorily for two
decades despite the absence of any apparent motive to
do so. The evidence must "ten[d] to exclude the
possibility" that petitioners underpriced respondents to
compete for business rather than to implement an

evidence, there is no "genuine issue for trial" under Rule
56(e), and petitioners are entitled to have summary
judgment reinstated.
VI
Our decision makes it unnecessary to reach the
sovereign compulsion issue. The heart of petitioners'
argument on that issue is that MITI, an agency of the
Government of Japan, required petitioners to fix
minimum prices for export to the United States, and
that petitioners are therefore immune from antitrust
liability for any scheme of which those minimum prices
were an integral part. As we discussed in Part II, supra,
respondents could not have suffered a cognizable injury
from any action that raised prices in the American CEP
market. If liable at all, petitioners are liable for conduct
that is distinct from the check-price agreements. The
sovereign compulsion question that both petitioners and
the Solicitor General urge us to decide thus is not
presented here.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
