In the first paragraph of its 24-page opinion the Court
states that the question to be decided is whether
allegations that "major telecommunications providers
engaged in certain parallel conduct unfavorable to
competition" suffice to state a violation of § 1 of the
Sherman Act. Ante, at 1961. The answer to that
question has been settled for more than 50 years. If that
were indeed the issue, a summary reversal citing
Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film
Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 74 S.Ct. 257, 98 L.Ed.
273 (1954), would adequately resolve this case. As
Theatre Enterprises held, parallel conduct is
circumstantial evidence admissible on the issue of
conspiracy, but it is not itself illegal. Id., at 540-542, 74
S.Ct. 257.
Thus, this is a case in which there is no dispute about
the substantive law. If the defendants acted
independently, their conduct was perfectly lawful. If,
however, that conduct is the product of a horizontal
agreement among potential competitors, it was
unlawful. Plaintiffs have alleged such an agreement and,
because the complaint was dismissed in advance of
answer, the allegation has not even been denied. Why,
then, does the case not proceed? Does a judicial opinion
that the charge is not "plausible" provide a legally
acceptable reason for dismissing the complaint? I think
not.
Respondents' amended complaint describes a variety of
circumstantial evidence and makes the straightforward
allegation that petitioners
"entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent
competitive entry in their respective local telephone and/or high
speed internet services markets and have agreed not to compete
with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to
one another." Amended Complaint in No. 02 CIV. 10220(GEL)
(SDNY) ¶ 51, App. 27 (hereinafter Complaint).
The complaint explains that, contrary to Congress'
expectation when it enacted the 1996
Telecommunications Act, and consistent with their own
economic self-interests, petitioner Incumbent Local
Exchange Carriers (ILECs) have assiduously avoided
infringing upon each other's markets and have refused
to permit nonincumbent competitors to access their
networks. The complaint quotes Richard Notebaert, the
former CEO of one such ILEC, as saying that competing
in a neighboring ILEC's territory "might be a good way
to turn a quick dollar but that doesn't make it right." Id.,
¶ 42, App. 22. Moreover, respondents allege that
petitioners "communicate amongst themselves" through
numerous industry associations. Id., ¶ 46, App. 23. In
sum, respondents allege that petitioners entered into an
agreement that has long been recognized as a classic per
se violation of the Sherman Act. See Report [127 S.Ct.
1975] of the Attorney General's National Committee to
Study the Antitrust Laws 26 (1955).
Under rules of procedure that have been well settled
since well before our decision in Theatre Enterprises, a
judge ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss a
complaint, "must accept as true all of the factual
allegations contained in the complaint." Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 508, n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152
L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); see Overstreet v. North Shore Corp.,
318 U.S. 125, 127, 63 S.Ct. 494, 87 L.Ed. 656 (1943). But
instead of requiring knowledgeable executives such as
Notebaert to respond to these allegations by way of
sworn depositions or other limited discovery—and
indeed without so much as requiring petitioners to file
an answer denying that they entered into any
agreement—the majority permits immediate dismissal
based on the assurances of company lawyers that
nothing untoward was afoot. The Court embraces the
argument of those lawyers that "there is no reason to
infer that the companies had agreed among themselves
to do what was only natural anyway," ante, at 1971; that
"there was just no need for joint encouragement to resist
the 1996 Act," ante, at 1971; and that the "natural
explanation for the noncompetition alleged is that the
former Government-sanctioned monopolists were
sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same
thing," ante, at 1972.
The Court and petitioners' legal team are no doubt
correct that the parallel conduct alleged is consistent
with the absence of any contract, combination, or
conspiracy. But that conduct is also entirely consistent
with the presence of the illegal agreement alleged in the
complaint. And the charge that petitioners "agreed not
to compete with one another" is not just one of "a few
stray statements," ante, at 1970; it is an allegation
describing unlawful conduct. As such, the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, our longstanding precedent, and
sound practice mandate that the District Court at least
require some sort of response from petitioners before
dismissing the case.
Two practical concerns presumably explain the Court's
dramatic departure from settled procedural law. Private
antitrust litigation can be enormously expensive, and
there is a risk that jurors may mistakenly conclude that
evidence of parallel conduct has proved that the parties
acted pursuant to an agreement when they in fact
merely made similar independent decisions. Those
concerns merit careful case management, including
strict control of discovery, careful scrutiny of evidence
at the summary judgment stage, and lucid instructions
to juries; they do not, however, justify the dismissal of
an adequately pleaded complaint without even requiring
the defendants to file answers denying a charge that they
in fact engaged in collective decisionmaking. More
importantly, they do not justify an interpretation of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that seems to
be driven by the majority's appraisal of the plausibility of
the ultimate factual allegation rather than its legal
sufficiency.
I
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules requires that a
complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The
rule did not come about by happenstance and its
language is not inadvertent. The English experience
with Byzantine special pleading rules—illustrated by the
hypertechnical Hilary rules of 1834[1] —made obvious
[127 S.Ct. 1976] the appeal of a pleading standard that
was easy for the common litigant to understand and
sufficed to put the defendant on notice as to the nature
of the claim against him and the relief sought. Stateside,
David Dudley Field developed the highly influential
New York Code of 1848, which required "[a] statement
of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary
and concise language, without repetition, and in such a
manner as to enable a person of common understanding
to know what is intended." An Act to Simplify and
Abridge the Practice, Pleadings and Proceedings of the
Courts of this State, ch. 379, § 120(2), 1848 N.Y. Laws
pp. 497, 521. Substantially similar language appeared in
the Federal Equity Rules adopted in 1912. See Fed.
Equity Rule 25 (requiring "a short and simple statement
of the ultimate facts upon which the plaintiff asks relief,
omitting any mere statement of evidence").
A difficulty arose, however, in that the Field Code and
its progeny required a plaintiff to plead "facts" rather
than "conclusions," a distinction that proved far easier to
say than to apply. As commentators have noted,
"it is virtually impossible logically to distinguish among `ultimate
facts,' `evidence,' and `conclusions.' Essentially any allegation in a
pleading must be an assertion that certain occurrences took place.
The pleading spectrum, passing from evidence through ultimate
facts to conclusions, is largely a continuum varying only in the
degree of particularity with which the occurrences are described."
Weinstein & Distler, Comments on Procedural Reform: Drafting
Pleading Rules, 57 Colum. L.Rev. 518, 520-521 (1957).
See also Cook, Statements of Fact in Pleading Under the
Codes, 21 Colum. L.Rev. 416, 417 (1921) (hereinafter
Cook) ("[T]here is no logical distinction between
statements which are grouped by the courts under the
phrases `statements of fact' and `conclusions of law'").
Rule 8 was directly responsive to this difficulty. Its
drafters intentionally avoided any reference to "facts" or
"evidence" or "conclusions." See 5 C. Wright & A.
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1216, p. 207
(3d ed.2004) (hereinafter Wright & Miller) ("The
substitution of `claim showing that the pleader is
entitled to relief' for the code formulation of the `facts'
constituting a `cause of action' was intended to avoid the
distinctions drawn under the codes among `evidentiary
facts,' `ultimate facts,' and `conclusions' . . .").
Under the relaxed pleading standards of the Federal
Rules, the idea was not to keep litigants out of court but
rather to keep them in. The merits of a claim would be
sorted out during a flexible pretrial process and, as
appropriate, through the crucible of trial. See
Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S., at 514, 122 S.Ct. 992 ("The
liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a) is the starting point
of a simplified pleading system, which was adopted to
focus litigation on the merits of a claim"). Charles E.
Clark, the "principal draftsman" of the Federal Rules,[2]
put it thus:
"Experience has shown . . . that we cannot expect the proof of the
case to be made through the pleadings, and that such proof is really
not their function. We can expect a general statement
distinguishing the case from all others, so that the manner and form
of trial and remedy expected are clear, and so that a permanent
judgment will result." The [127 S.Ct. 1977] New Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure: The Last Phase—Underlying Philosophy Embodied
in Some of the Basic Provisions of the New Procedure, 23 A.B.A.J.
976, 977 (1937) (hereinafter Clark, New Federal Rules).
The pleading paradigm under the new Federal Rules
was well illustrated by the inclusion in the appendix of
Form 9, a complaint for negligence. As relevant, the
Form 9 complaint states only: "On June 1, 1936, in a
public highway called Boylston Street in Boston,
Massachusetts, defendant negligently drove a motor
vehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing said
highway." Form 9, Complaint for Negligence, Forms
App., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 28 U.S.C.App., p. 829
(hereinafter Form 9). The complaint then describes the
plaintiff's injuries and demands judgment. The asserted
ground for relief— namely, the defendant's negligent
driving—would have been called a "`conclusion of law'"
under the code pleading of old. See, e.g., Cook 419. But
that bare allegation suffices under a system that
"restrict[s] the pleadings to the task of general noticegiving
and invest[s] the deposition-discovery process
with a vital role in the preparation for trial."[3] Hickman
v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 501, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451
(1947); see also Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S., at 513, n. 4, 122
S.Ct. 992 (citing Form 9 as an example of "`the
simplicity and brevity of statement which the rules
contemplate'"); Thomson v. Washington, 362 F.3d 969,
970 (C.A.7 2004) (Posner, J.) ("The federal rules
replaced fact pleading with notice pleading").
II
It is in the context of this history that Conley v. Gibson,
355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), must be
understood. The Conley plaintiffs were black railroad
workers who alleged that their union local had refused
to protect them against discriminatory discharges, in
violation of the National Railway Labor Act. The union
sought to dismiss the complaint on the ground that its
general allegations of discriminatory treatment by the
defendants lacked sufficient specificity. Writing for a
unanimous Court, Justice Black rejected the union's
claim as foreclosed by the language of Rule 8. Id., at 47-
48, 78 S.Ct. 99. In the course of doing so, he articulated
the formulation the Court rejects today: "In appraising
the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the
accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed
for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond
doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in
support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."
Id., at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99.
Consistent with the design of the Federal Rules,
Conley's "no set of facts" formulation permits outright
dismissal only when proceeding to discovery or beyond
would be futile. Once it is clear that a plaintiff has stated
a claim that, if true, would entitle him to relief, matters
of proof are appropriately relegated to other stages of
the trial process. Today, however, in its explanation of a
decision to dismiss a complaint that it regards as a
fishing expedition, the Court scraps Conley's "no set of
facts" language. Concluding that the phrase has been
"questioned, criticized, and explained away long
enough," ante, at 1969, the Court dismisses it as careless
composition.
[127 S.Ct. 1978] If Conley's "no set of facts" language is to
be interred, let it not be without a eulogy. That exact
language, which the majority says has "puzzl[ed] the
profession for 50 years," ibid., has been cited as
authority in a dozen opinions of this Court and four
separate writings.[4] In not one of those 16 opinions was
the language "questioned," "criticized," or "explained
away." Indeed, today's opinion is the first by any
Member of this Court to express any doubt as to the
adequacy of the Conley formulation. Taking their cues
from the federal courts, 26 States and the District of
Columbia utilize as their standard for dismissal of a
complaint the very language the majority repudiates:
whether it appears "beyond doubt" that "no set of facts"
in support of the claim would entitle the plaintiff to
relief.[5]
[127 S.Ct. 1979] Petitioners have not requested that the
Conley formulation be retired, nor have any of the six
amici who filed briefs in support of petitioners. I would
not rewrite the Nation's civil procedure textbooks and
call into doubt the pleading rules of most of its States
without far more informed deliberation as to the costs
of doing so. Congress has established a process—a
rulemaking process—for revisions of that order. See 28
U.S.C. §§ 2072-2074 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV).
Today's majority calls Conley's "`no set of facts'"
language "an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted
pleading standard: once a claim has been stated
adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of
facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint."
Ante, at 1969. This is not and cannot be what the
Conley Court meant. First, as I have explained, and as
the Conley Court well knew, the pleading standard the
Federal Rules meant to codify does not require, or even
invite, the pleading of facts.[6] The "pleading standard"
label the majority gives to what it reads into the Conley
opinion—a statement of the permissible factual support
for an adequately pleaded complaint—would not,
therefore, have impressed the Conley Court itself.
Rather, that Court would have understood the
majority's remodeling of its language to express an
evidentiary standard, which the Conley Court had
neither need nor want to explicate. Second, it is
pellucidly clear that the Conley Court was interested in
what a complaint must contain, not what it may
contain. In fact, the Court said without qualification that
it was "appraising the sufficiency of the complaint." 355
U.S., at 45, 78 S.Ct. 99 [127 S.Ct. 1980] (emphasis added).
It was, to paraphrase today's majority, describing "the
minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a
complaint's survival," ante, at 1969.
We can be triply sure as to Conley's meaning by
examining the three Court of Appeals cases the Conley
Court cited as support for the "accepted rule" that "a
complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff
can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which
would entitle him to relief." 355 U.S., at 45-46, 78 S.Ct.
99. In the first case, Leimer v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co.
of Worcester, Mass., 108 F.2d 302 (C.A.8 1940), the
plaintiff alleged that she was the beneficiary of a life
insurance plan and that the insurance company was
wrongfully withholding proceeds from her. In reversing
the District Court's grant of the defendant's motion to
dismiss, the Eighth Circuit noted that court's own
longstanding rule that, to warrant dismissal, "'it should
appear from the allegations that a cause of action does
not exist, rather than that a cause of action has been
defectively stated.'" Id., at 305 (quoting Winget v.
Rockwood, 69 F.2d 326, 329 (C.A.8 1934)).
The Leimer court viewed the Federal Rules—specifically
Rules 8(a)(2), 12(b)(6), 12(e) (motion for a more definite
statement), and 56 (motion for summary judgment)—as
reinforcing the notion that "there is no justification for
dismissing a complaint for insufficiency of statement,
except where it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff
would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts
which could be proved in support of the claim." 108
F.2d, at 306. The court refuted in the strongest terms
any suggestion that the unlikelihood of recovery should
determine the fate of a complaint: "No matter how
improbable it may be that she can prove her claim, she is
entitled to an opportunity to make the attempt, and is
not required to accept as final a determination of her
rights based upon inferences drawn in favor of the
defendant from her amended complaint." Ibid.
The Third Circuit relied on Leimer's admonition in
Continental Collieries, Inc. v. Shober, 130 F.2d 631
(1942), which the Conley Court also cited in support of
its "no set of facts" formulation. In a diversity action the
plaintiff alleged breach of contract, but the District
Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the
contract appeared to be unenforceable under state law.
The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that there
were facts in dispute that went to the enforceability of
the contract, and that the rule at the pleading stage was
as in Leimer: "No matter how likely it may seem that the
pleader will be unable to prove his case, he is entitled,
upon averring a claim, to an opportunity to try to prove
it." 130 F.3d, at 635.
The third case the Conley Court cited approvingly was
written by Judge Clark himself. In Dioguardi v.
Durning, 139 F.2d 774 (C.A.2 1944), the pro se plaintiff,
an importer of "tonics," charged the customs inspector
with auctioning off the plaintiff's former merchandise
for less than was bid for it—and indeed for an amount
equal to the plaintiff's own bid—and complained that
two cases of tonics went missing three weeks before the
sale. The inference, hinted at by the averments but
never stated in so many words, was that the defendant
fraudulently denied the plaintiff his rightful claim to the
tonics, which, if true, would have violated federal law.
Writing six years after the adoption of the Federal Rules
he held the lead rein in drafting, Judge Clark said that
the defendant
"could have disclosed the facts from his point of view, in advance of
a trial if he [127 S.Ct. 1981] chose, by asking for a pre-trial hearing or
by moving for a summary judgment with supporting affidavits. But,
as it stands, we do not see how the plaintiff may properly be
deprived of his day in court to show what he obviously so firmly
believes and what for present purposes defendant must be taken as
admitting." Id., at 775.
As any civil procedure student knows, Judge Clark's
opinion disquieted the defense bar and gave rise to a
movement to revise Rule 8 to require a plaintiff to plead
a "`cause of action.'" See 5 Wright & Miller § 1201, at
86-87. The movement failed, see ibid.; Dioguardi was
explicitly approved in Conley; and "[i]n retrospect the
case itself seems to be a routine application of principles
that are universally accepted," 5 Wright & Miller §
1220, at 284-285.
In light of Leimer, Continental Collieries, and
Dioguardi, Conley's statement that a complaint is not to
be dismissed unless "no set of facts" in support thereof
would entitle the plaintiff to relief is hardly "puzzling,"
ante, at 1969. It reflects a philosophy that, unlike in the
days of code pleading, separating the wheat from the
chaff is a task assigned to the pretrial and trial process.
Conley's language, in short, captures the policy choice
embodied in the Federal Rules and binding on the
federal courts.
We have consistently reaffirmed that basic
understanding of the Federal Rules in the half century
since Conley. For example, in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416
U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), we
reversed the Court of Appeals' dismissal on the
pleadings when the respondents, the Governor and
other officials of the State of Ohio, argued that
petitioners' claims were barred by sovereign immunity.
In a unanimous opinion by then-Justice Rehnquist, we
emphasized that
"[w]hen a federal court reviews the sufficiency of a complaint,
before the reception of any evidence either by affidavit or
admissions, its task is necessarily a limited one. The issue is not
whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant
is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims. Indeed it may
appear on the face of the pleadings that a recovery is very remote
and unlikely but that is not the test." Id., at 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683
(emphasis added).
The Rhodes plaintiffs had "alleged generally and in
conclusory terms" that the defendants, by calling out the
National Guard to suppress the Kent State University
student protests, "were guilty of wanton, wilful and
negligent conduct." Krause v. Rhodes, 471 F.2d 430, 433
(C.A.6 1972). We reversed the Court of Appeals on the
ground that "[w]hatever the plaintiffs may or may not
be able to establish as to the merits of their allegations,
their claims, as stated in the complaints, given the
favorable reading required by the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure," were not barred by the Eleventh
Amendment because they were styled as suits against
the defendants in their individual capacities. 416 U.S., at
238, 94 S.Ct. 1683.
We again spoke with one voice against efforts to expand
pleading requirements beyond their appointed limits in
Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence
and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 113 S.Ct. 1160,
122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993). Writing for the unanimous
Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist rebuffed the Fifth
Circuit's effort to craft a standard for pleading municipal
liability that accounted for "the enormous expense
involved today in litigation," Leatherman v. Tarrant
Cty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 954
F.2d 1054, 1057 (1992) (internal quotation marks
omitted), by requiring a plaintiff to "state with factual
detail and [127 S.Ct. 1982] particularity the basis for the
claim which necessarily includes why the defendantofficial
cannot successfully maintain the defense of
immunity." Leatherman, 507 U.S., at 167, 113 S.Ct. 1160
(internal quotation marks omitted). We found this
language inconsistent with Rules 8(a)(2) and 9(b) and
emphasized that motions to dismiss were not the place
to combat discovery abuse: "In the absence of [an
amendment to Rule 9(b)], federal courts and litigants
must rely on summary judgment and control of
discovery to weed out unmeritorious claims sooner
rather than later." Id., at 168-169, 113 S.Ct. 1160.
Most recently, in Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct.
992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1, we were faced with a case more
similar to the present one than the majority will allow.
In discrimination cases, our precedents require a
plaintiff at the summary judgment stage to produce
either direct evidence of discrimination or, if the claim is
based primarily on circumstantial evidence, to meet the
shifting evidentiary burdens imposed under the
framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668
(1973). See, e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.
Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d
523 (1985). Swierkiewicz alleged that he had been
terminated on account of national origin in violation of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Second
Circuit dismissed the suit on the pleadings because he
had not pleaded a prima facie case of discrimination
under the McDonnell Douglas standard.
We reversed in another unanimous opinion, holding
that "under a notice pleading system, it is not
appropriate to require a plaintiff to plead facts
establishing a prima facie case because the McDonnell
Douglas framework does not apply in every
employment discrimination case." Swierkiewicz, 534
U.S., at 511, 122 S.Ct. 992. We also observed that Rule
8(a)(2) does not contemplate a court's passing on the
merits of a litigant's claim at the pleading stage. Rather,
the "simplified notice pleading standard" of the Federal
Rules "relies on liberal discovery rules and summary
judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues
and to dispose of unmeritorious claims." Id., at 512, 122
S.Ct. 992; see Brief for United States et al. as Amici
Curiae in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., O.T.2001, No.
00-1853, p. 10 (stating that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not
"an appropriate device for testing the truth of what is
asserted or for determining whether a plaintiff has any
evidence to back up what is in the complaint" (internal
quotation marks omitted)).[7]
As in the discrimination context, we have developed an
evidentiary framework for evaluating claims under § 1
of the Sherman Act when those claims rest on entirely
circumstantial evidence of conspiracy. See Matsushita
Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574,
106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Under
Matsushita, a plaintiff's allegations of an illegal
conspiracy may not, at the summary judgment stage,
rest solely on the inferences that may be drawn from the
parallel conduct of the defendants. In order to survive a
Rule 56 motion, a § 1 plaintiff "must present evidence
`that tends to exclude [127 S.Ct. 1983] the possibility' that
the alleged conspirators acted independently.'" Id., at
588, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (quoting Monsanto Co. v. SprayRite
Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79
L.Ed.2d 775 (1984)). That is, the plaintiff "must show
that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of
the competing inferences of independent action or
collusive action." 475 U.S., at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348.
Everything today's majority says would therefore make
perfect sense if it were ruling on a Rule 56 motion for
summary judgment and the evidence included nothing
more than the Court has described. But it should go
without saying in the wake of Swierkiewicz that a
heightened production burden at the summary
judgment stage does not translate into a heightened
pleading burden at the complaint stage. The majority
rejects the complaint in this case because—in light of the
fact that the parallel conduct alleged is consistent with
ordinary market behavior—the claimed conspiracy is
"conceivable" but not "plausible," ante, at 1974. I have
my doubts about the majority's assessment of the
plausibility of this alleged conspiracy. See Part III, infra.
But even if the majority's speculation is correct, its
"plausibility" standard is irreconcilable with Rule 8 and
with our governing precedents. As we made clear in
Swierkiewicz and Leatherman, fear of the burdens of
litigation does not justify factual conclusions supported
only by lawyers' arguments rather than sworn denials or
admissible evidence.
This case is a poor vehicle for the Court's new pleading
rule, for we have observed that "in antitrust cases, where
'the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged
conspirators,' . . . dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff
ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very
sparingly." Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex
Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 746, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 48 L.Ed.2d
338 (1976) (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d
458 (1962)); see also Knuth v. Erie-Crawford Dairy
Cooperative Assn., 395 F.2d 420, 423 (C.A.3 1968)
("The `liberal' approach to the consideration of antitrust
complaints is important because inherent in such an
action is the fact that all the details and specific facts
relied upon cannot properly be set forth as part of the
pleadings"). Moreover, the fact that the Sherman Act
authorizes the recovery of treble damages and attorney's
fees for successful plaintiffs indicates that Congress
intended to encourage, rather than discourage, private
enforcement of the law. See Radovich v. National
Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 454, 77 S.Ct. 390, 1
L.Ed.2d 456 (1957) ("Congress itself has placed the
private antitrust litigant in a most favorable position . . .
. In the face of such a policy this Court should not add
requirements to burden the private litigant beyond what
is specifically set forth by Congress in those laws"). It is
therefore more, not less, important in antitrust cases to
resist the urge to engage in armchair economics at the
pleading stage.
The same year we decided Conley, Judge Clark wrote,
presciently,
"I fear that every age must learn its lesson that special pleading
cannot be made to do the service of trial and that live issues
between active litigants are not to be disposed of or evaded on the
paper pleadings, i.e., the formalistic claims of the parties.
Experience has found no quick and easy short cut for trials in cases
generally and antitrust cases in particular." Special Pleading in the
"Big Case"? in Procedure—The Handmaid of Justice 147, 148 (C.
Wright & H. Reasoner eds.1965) (hereinafter [127 S.Ct. 1984] Clark,
Special Pleading in the Big Case) (emphasis added).
In this "Big Case," the Court succumbs to the temptation
that previous Courts have steadfastly resisted.[8] While
the majority assures us that it is not applying any
"`heightened'" pleading standard, see ante, at 1973, n.
14, I shall now explain why I have a difficult time
understanding its opinion any other way.
III
The Court does not suggest that an agreement to do
what the plaintiffs allege would be permissible under the
antitrust laws, see, e.g., Associated Gen. Contractors of
Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526-527, 103 S.Ct.
897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983). Nor does the Court hold
that these plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury
entitling them to sue for damages under those laws, see
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S.
477, 489-490, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977).
Rather, the theory on which the Court permits dismissal
is that, so far as the Federal Rules are concerned, no
agreement has been alleged at all. This is a mindboggling
conclusion.
As the Court explains, prior to the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 the law prohibited the
defendants from competing with each other. The new
statute was enacted to replace a monopolistic market
with a competitive one. The Act did not merely require
the regional monopolists to take affirmative steps to
facilitate entry to new competitors, see Verizon
Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V.
Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 402, 124 S.Ct. 872, 157
L.Ed.2d 823 (2004); it also permitted the existing firms
to compete with each other and to expand their
operations into previously forbidden territory. See 47
U.S.C. § 271. Each of the defendants decided not to take
the latter step. That was obviously an extremely
important business decision, and I am willing to
presume that each company acted entirely
independently in reaching that decision. I am even
willing to entertain the majority's belief that any
agreement among the companies was unlikely. But the
plaintiffs allege in three places in their complaint, ¶¶ 4,
51, 64, App. 11, 27, 30, that the ILECs did in fact agree
both to prevent competitors from entering into their
local markets and to forgo competition with each other.
And as the Court [127 S.Ct. 1985] recognizes, at the
motion to dismiss stage, a judge assumes "that all the
allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in
fact)." Ante, at 1965.
The majority circumvents this obvious obstacle to
dismissal by pretending that it does not exist. The Court
admits that "in form a few stray statements in the
complaint speak directly of agreement," but disregards
those allegations by saying that "on fair reading these are
merely legal conclusions resting on the prior allegations"
of parallel conduct. Ante, at 1970. The Court's
dichotomy between factual allegations and "legal
conclusions" is the stuff of a bygone era, supra, at 1976-
1977. That distinction was a defining feature of code
pleading, see generally Clark, The Complaint in Code
Pleading, 35 Yale L.J. 259 (1925-1926), but was
conspicuously abolished when the Federal Rules were
enacted in 1938. See United States v. Employing
Plasterers Assn. of Chicago, 347 U.S. 186, 188, 74 S.Ct.
452, 98 L.Ed. 618 (1954) (holding, in an antitrust case,
that the Government's allegations of effects on interstate
commerce must be taken into account in deciding
whether to dismiss the complaint "[w]hether these
charges be called `allegations of fact' or `mere
conclusions of the pleader'"); Brownlee v. Conine, 957
F.2d 353, 354 (C.A.7 1992) ("The Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure establish a system of notice pleading rather
than of fact pleading, . . . so the happenstance that a
complaint is `conclusory,' whatever exactly that
overused lawyers' cliche means, does not automatically
condemn it"); Walker Distributing Co. v. Lucky Lager
Brewing Co., 323 F.2d 1, 3-4 (C.A.9 1963) ("[O]ne
purpose of Rule 8 was to get away from the highly
technical distinction between statements of fact and
conclusions of law . . ."); Oil, Chemical & Atomic
Workers Int'l Union v. Delta, 277 F.2d 694, 697 (C.A.6
1960) ("Under the notice system of pleading established
by the Rules of Civil Procedure,. . . the ancient
distinction between pleading `facts' and `conclusions' is
no longer significant"); 5 Wright & Miller § 1218, at 267
("[T]he federal rules do not prohibit the pleading of
facts or legal conclusions as long as fair notice is given to
the parties"). "Defendants entered into a contract" is no
more a legal conclusion than "defendant negligently
drove," see Form 9; supra, at 1977. Indeed it is less of
one.[9]
Even if I were inclined to accept the Court's
anachronistic dichotomy and ignore the complaint's
actual allegations, I would dispute the Court's suggestion
that any inference of agreement from petitioners'
parallel conduct is "implausible." Many years ago a truly
great economist perceptively observed that "[p]eople of
the same trade seldom meet together, even for
merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a
conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to
raise prices." A. Smith, An Inquiry Into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations, in 39 Great Books of
the Western World 55 (R. Hutchins & M. Adler eds.
1952). I am not so cynical as to accept that sentiment at
face value, but I need not do so here. Respondents'
complaint [127 S.Ct. 1986] points not only to petitioners'
numerous opportunities to meet with each other,
Complaint ¶ 46, App. 23,[10] but also to Notebaert's
curious statement that encroaching on a fellow
incumbent's territory "might be a good way to turn a
quick dollar but that doesn't make it right," id., ¶ 42,
App. 22. What did he mean by that? One possible
(indeed plausible) inference is that he meant that while
it would be in his company's economic self-interest to
compete with its brethren, he had agreed with his
competitors not to do so. According to the complaint,
that is how the Illinois Coalition for Competitive
Telecom construed Notebaert's statement, id., ¶ 44,
App. 22 (calling the statement "evidence of potential
collusion among regional Bell phone monopolies to not
compete against one another and kill off potential
competitors in local phone service"), and that is how
Members of Congress construed his company's
behavior, id., ¶ 45, App. 23 (describing a letter to the
Justice Department requesting an investigation into the
possibility that the ILECs'"very apparent noncompetition
policy" was coordinated).
Perhaps Notebaert meant instead that competition
would be sensible in the short term but not in the long
run. That's what his lawyers tell us anyway. See Brief for
Petitioners 36. But I would think that no one would
know better what Notebaert meant than Notebaert
himself. Instead of permitting respondents to ask
Notebaert, however, the Court looks to other quotes
from that and other articles and decides that what he
meant was that entering new markets as a CLEC would
not be a "`sustainable economic model.'" Ante, at 1972-
1973, n. 13. Never mind that—as anyone ever
interviewed knows—a newspaper article is hardly a
verbatim transcript; the writer selects quotes to package
his story, not to record a subject's views for posterity.
But more importantly the District Court was required at
this stage of the proceedings to construe Notebaert's
ambiguous statement in the plaintiffs' favor.[11] See
Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 768, n. 1, 104 S.Ct. 3315,
82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). The inference the statement
supports—that simultaneous decisions by ILECs not
even to attempt to poach customers from one another
once the law authorized them to do so were the product
of an agreement—sits comfortably within the realm of
possibility. That is all the Rules require.
To be clear, if I had been the trial judge in this case, I
would not have permitted the plaintiffs to engage in
massive discovery based solely on the allegations in this
complaint. On the other hand, I surely would not have
dismissed the complaint [127 S.Ct. 1987] without
requiring the defendants to answer the charge that they
"have agreed not to compete with one another and
otherwise allocated customers and markets to one
another."[12] ¶ 51, App. 27. Even a sworn denial of that
charge would not justify a summary dismissal without
giving the plaintiffs the opportunity to take depositions
from Notebaert and at least one responsible executive
representing each of the other defendants.
Respondents in this case proposed a plan of "`phased
discovery'" limited to the existence of the alleged
conspiracy and class certification. Brief for Respondents
25-26. Two petitioners rejected the plan. Ibid. Whether
or not respondents' proposed plan was sensible, it was
an appropriate subject for negotiation.[13] Given the
charge in the complaint—buttressed by the common
sense of Adam Smith—I cannot say that the possibility
that joint discussions [127 S.Ct. 1988] and perhaps some
agreements played a role in petitioners' decisionmaking
process is so implausible that dismissing the complaint
before any defendant has denied the charge is preferable
to granting respondents even a minimal opportunity to
prove their claims. See Clark, New Federal Rules 977
("[T]hrough the weapons of discovery and summary
judgment we have developed new devices, with more
appropriate penalties to aid in matters of proof, and do
not need to force the pleadings to their less appropriate
function").
I fear that the unfortunate result of the majority's new
pleading rule will be to invite lawyers' debates over
economic theory to conclusively resolve antitrust suits
in the absence of any evidence. It is no surprise that the
antitrust defense bar— among whom "lament" as to
inadequate judicial supervision of discovery is most
"common," see ante, at 1967—should lobby for this state
of affairs. But "we must recall that their primary
responsibility is to win cases for their clients, not to
improve law administration for the public." Clark,
Special Pleading in the Big Case 152. As we did in our
prior decisions, we should have instructed them that
their remedy was to seek to amend the Federal
Rules—not our interpretation of them.[14] See
Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S., at 515, 122 S.Ct. 992; CrawfordEl
v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 595, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140
L.Ed.2d 759 (1998); Leatherman, 507 U.S., at 168, 113
S.Ct. 1160.
IV
Just a few weeks ago some of my colleagues explained
that a strict interpretation of the literal text of statutory
language is essential to avoid judicial decisions that are
not faithful to the intent of Congress. Zuni Public
School Dist. No. 89 v. Department of Education, 550
U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1534, 167 L.Ed.2d 449 (2007)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). I happen to believe that there
are cases in which other tools of construction are more
reliable than text, but I agree of course that
congressional intent should guide us in matters of
statutory interpretation. Id., at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1534
(STEVENS, J., concurring). This is a case in which the
intentions of the drafters of three important sources of
law—the Sherman Act, the Telecommunications Act of
1996, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure— all
point unmistakably in the same direction, yet the Court
marches resolutely the other way. Whether the Court's
actions will benefit only defendants in antitrust trebledamages
cases, or whether its test for the sufficiency of a
complaint will inure to the benefit of all civil defendants,
is a question that the future will answer. But that the
Court has announced a significant new rule that does
not even purport to respond [127 S.Ct. 1989] to any
congressional command is glaringly obvious.
The transparent policy concern that drives the decision
is the interest in protecting antitrust defendants—who
in this case are some of the wealthiest corporations in
our economy—from the burdens of pretrial discovery.
Ante, at 1966-1967. Even if it were not apparent that
the legal fees petitioners have incurred in arguing the
merits of their Rule 12(b) motion have far exceeded the
cost of limited discovery, or that those discovery costs
would burden respondents as well as petitioners,[15] that
concern would not provide an adequate justification for
this law-changing decision. For in the final analysis it is
only a lack of confidence in the ability of trial judges to
control discovery, buttressed by appellate judges'
independent appraisal of the plausibility of profoundly
serious factual allegations, that could account for this
stark break from precedent.
If the allegation of conspiracy happens to be true, today's
decision obstructs the congressional policy favoring
competition that undergirds both the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Sherman Act
itself. More importantly, even if there is abundant
evidence that the allegation is untrue, directing that the
case be dismissed without even looking at any of that
evidence marks a fundamental—and unjustified—change
in the character of pretrial practice.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
