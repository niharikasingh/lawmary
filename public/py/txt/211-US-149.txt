Two questions of law were raised by the demurrer to
the bill, were brought here by appeal, and have been
argued before us. They are, first, whether that part of
the act of Congress of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584),
which forbids the giving of free passes or the collection
of any different compensation for transportation of
passengers than that specified in the tariff filed, makes it
unlawful to perform a contract for transportation of
persons, who in good faith, before the passage of the act,
had accepted such contract in satisfaction of a valid
cause of action against the railroad; and, second,
whether the statute, if it should be construed to render
such a contract unlawful, is in [211 U.S. 152] violation of
the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. We do not deem it necessary, however, to
consider either of these questions, because, in our
opinion, the court below was without jurisdiction of the
cause. Neither party has questioned that jurisdiction, but
it is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court, which is defined and limited by
statute, is not exceeded. This duty we have frequently
performed of our own motion. Mansfield, &c. Railway

There was no diversity of citizenship and it is not and
cannot be suggested that there was any ground of
jurisdiction, except that the case was a "suit . . . arising
under the Constitution and laws of the United States."
Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, 434. It is the
settled interpretation of these words, as used in this
statute, conferring jurisdiction, that a suit arises under
the Constitution and laws of the United States only
when the plaintiff's statement of his own cause of action
shows that it is based upon those laws or that
Constitution. It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges
some anticipated defense to his cause of action and
asserts that the defense is invalidated by some provision
of the Constitution of the United States. Although such
allegations show that very likely, in the course of the
litigation, a question under the Constitution would
arise, they do not show that the suit, that is, the
plaintiff's original cause of action, arises under the
Constitution. In Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank,
152 U.S. 454, the plaintiff, the State of Tennessee,
brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States to
recover from the defendant certain taxes alleged to be
due under the laws of the State. The plaintiff alleged that
the defendant claimed an immunity from the taxation by
virtue of its charter, and that therefore the tax was void,
because in violation of the provision of the Constitution
of the United [211 U.S. 153] States, which forbids any
State from passing a law impairing the obligation of
contracts. The cause was held to be beyond the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by
Mr. Justice Gray (p. 464), "a suggestion of one party,
that the other will or may set up a claim under the
Constitution or laws of the United States, does not make
the suit one arising under that Constitution or those
laws." Again, in Boston & Montana Consolidated
Copper & Silver Mining Company v. Montana Ore
Purchasing Company, 188 U.S. 632, the plaintiff
brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the conversion of copper ore and for an injunction
against its continuance. The plaintiff then alleged, for
the purpose of showing jurisdiction, in substance, that
the defendant would set up in defense certain laws of the
United States. The cause was held to be beyond the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by
Mr. Justice Peckham (pp. 638, 639).
"It would be wholly unnecessary and improper in order
to prove complainant's cause of action to go into any
matters of defence which the defendants might possibly
set up and then attempt to reply to such defence, and
thus, if possible, to show that a Federal question might
or probably would arise in the course of the trial of the
case. To allege such defence and then make an answer to
it before the defendant has the opportunity to itself
plead or prove its own defence is inconsistent with any
known rule of pleading so far as we are aware, and is
improper.
"The rule is a reasonable and just one that the
complainant in the first instance shall be confined to a
statement of its cause of action, leaving to the defendant
to set up in his answer what his defence is and, if
anything more than a denial of complainant's cause of
action, imposing upon the defendant the burden of
proving such defence.
"Conforming itself to that rule the complainant would
not, in the assertion or proof of its cause of action, bring
up a single Federal question. The presentation of its
cause of action would not show that it was one arising
under the Constitution or laws of the United States.
[211 U.S. 154] "The only way in which it might be
claimed that a Federal question was presented would be
in the complainant's statement of what the defence of
defendants would be and complainant's answer to such
defence. Under these circumstances the case is brought
within the rule laid down in Tennessee v. Union &
Planters' Bank, 152 U.S. 454. That case has been cited
and approved many times since, . . ."
The interpretation of the act which we have stated was
first announced in Metcalf v. Watertown, 128 U.S. 586,
and has since been repeated and applied in Colorado

The application of this rule to the case at bar is decisive
against the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.
It is ordered that the
Judgment be reversed and the case remitted to the
Circuit Court with instructions to dismiss the suit for
want of jurisdiction.
