It is my conclusion that the judgment of the trial court
should be affirmed, and I dissent from that portion of
the majority opinion which after determining that
Chandler was obligated to pay for the plywood it
received, then proceeds to grant an offset to Chandler
for an alleged debt owed to it by North America
Millwork.
[518 P.2d 1207] The basic reason for this dissent is that
the majority opinion in effect grants to Chandler an
offset for a trade debt allegedly due Chandler from
North America, who is neither a party to this action, nor
in privity with Continental. Stringent requirements are
established for a court to recognize an offset. See, Brown
v. Porter, 42 Idaho 295, 245 P. 398 (1926), which
considered the provisions governing the right to a
setoff, C.S. §§ 6694-6697 (I.C. §§ 5-612 to 5-615). See
I.R.C.P. 13(a) and 13(b). In Petersen v. Lyders, 139
Cal.App. 303, 33 P.2d 1030, 1031 (1934), cert. den. 294
U.S. 716, 55 S.Ct. 514, 79 L.Ed. 1249, reh. den. 294 U.S.
734, 55 S.Ct. 635, 79 L.Ed. 1262, the Supreme Court of
California considered statutes governing the right to
setoff which were identical to Idaho's:
"It is elementary that a set-off may not be invoked unless the parties
and the debts are mutual and that the doctrine of mutuality requires
that the debts be due to and from the same persons in the same
capacity."
Later in Advance Ind. Fin. Co. v. Western Equities, Inc.,
173 Cal.App.2d 420, 343 P.2d 408 (1959), the California
Supreme Court again emphasized the necessity of
mutuality in setoff cases in the following language:
"A counterclaim or a setoff is defined as a cause of action in favor of
the defendant on which he might have sued the plaintiff in a
separate action and, in the case of a counterclaim, might have
obtained affirmative relief * * *. A claim based on an equitable right
may be set up as a counterclaim against a claim based on a legal
right. While the doctrine of setoff, as distinguished from statutory
counterclaim, is eminently an equitable one, the equitable right is
founded on the idea that mutual existing indebtedness, arising out
of contracts between parties to the record, creates payment of both
demands so far as they equal each other. The two demands must be
mutual." (Citations omitted.) 343 P.2d at 412.
See also, Cruzan v. Franklin Stores Corp., 72 N.M. 42,
380 P.2d 190 (N.M. 1963); Sarkeys v. Marlow, 205 Okl.
15, 235 P.2d 676 (1951); A.S. & R. Co. v. Swisshelm
Gold Silver Co., 63 Ariz. 204, 160 P.2d 757 (Ariz. 1945).
In this case there is no record of mutuality. The alleged
debt is owing from North America to Chandler,
Continental has not been shown to have been connected
with North America by agency, contract, or assignment,
and the trial court did not find any such relationship
between Continental and North America.
The majority opinion reaches its final conclusion on the
basis that Chandler was going to be unjustly enriched if
it was allowed to retain the plywood shipped by
Continental without paying somebody. By some process
the opinion places fault on the part of Continental, and
then states "Under these circumstances we feel that it
would not be unjust to require Chandler to pay only that
amount which he would have had to pay to North
America had the transaction gone the way Chandler had
intended and attempted to have it go." This conclusion
is then followed by a refusal of the majority opinion to
consider what in my opinion is one of the crucial points
of the case, i.e., whether Continental ever received the
copies of the acknowledgment of orders on which Earl
Chandler had written "Purchased from North America
Millwork. Earl Chandler 7-7-69."
The majority opinion in faulting Continental for its
activities in effect holds the trial court erred when it
specifically found "the return acknowledgment with the
notation by Mr. Earl Chandler was not received by
Continental Forest Products." At trial both parties
contested this issue and appellant assigned the issue as
an error on appeal. In such cases, when there is
testimony by the addressee denying receipt of the mailed
instrument, an issue of fact is presented for resolution
by the trier [518 P.2d 1208] of facts. American Surety Co.
v. Blake, 54 Idaho 1, 27 P.2d 972 (1933); IX Wigmore
(3d ed.) § 2519; Bell, Handbook of Evidence (1972), p.
239. The trial court sat as a trier of the facts and its
function was to weigh the evidence and judge the
credibility of the witnesses. A conflict in the evidence as
to the receipt of the acknowledgments was presented,
and in light of competent, substantial, although
conflicting evidence, the trial court's findings in this
regard should have been considered and upheld. Ivie v.
Peck, 94 Idaho 625, 495 P.2d 1110 (1972).
There are numerous other points wherein I disagree
with the majority opinion, particularly in regard to what
it claims the trial court found. Extended discussion of
these would be futile in a dissent and would unduly
lengthen it.
