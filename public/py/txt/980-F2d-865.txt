This appeal concerns venue in an action brought under
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§
1692-1692o (1988). Specifically, the issue is whether
venue exists in a district in which the debtor resides and
to which a bill collector's demand for payment was
forwarded. The issue arises on an appeal by Phillip E.
Bates from the May 21, 1992, judgment of the District
Court for the Western District of New York (William
M. Skretny, Judge), dismissing his complaint because of
improper venue. We conclude that venue was proper
under 28 U.S.C.A. § 1391(b)(2) (West Supp.1992) and
therefore reverse and remand.
Background
Bates commenced this action in the Western District of
New York upon receipt of a collection notice from C &
S Adjusters, Inc. ("C & S"). Bates alleged violations of the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and demanded
statutory damages, costs, and attorney's fees. The facts
relevant to venue are not in dispute. Bates incurred the
debt in question while he was a resident of the Western
District of Pennsylvania. The creditor, a corporation
with its principal place of business in that District,
referred the account to C & S, a local collection agency
which transacts no regular business in New York. Bates
had meanwhile moved to the Western District of New
York. When C & S mailed a collection notice to Bates at
his Pennsylvania address, the Postal Service forwarded
the notice to Bates' new address in New York.
In its answer, C & S asserted two affirmative defenses
and also counterclaimed for costs, alleging that the
action was instituted in bad faith and for purposes of
harassment. C & S subsequently filed a motion to
dismiss for improper venue, which the District Court
granted.
Discussion
1. Venue and the 1990 amendments to 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b)
Bates concedes that the only plausible venue provision
for this action is 28 U.S.C.A. § 1391(b)(2), which allows
an action to be brought in "a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to
the claim occurred." Prior to 1990, section 1391 allowed
for venue in "the judicial district ... in which the claim
arose." 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) (1988). This case represents
our first opportunity to consider the significance of the
1990 amendments.
Prior to 1966, venue was proper in federal question
cases, absent a special venue statute, only in the
defendant's state of citizenship. If a plaintiff sought to
sue multiple defendants who were citizens of different
states, there might be no district where the entire action
could be brought. See 1A Part 2 James W. Moore,
Moore's Federal Practice, ¶ 0.342[4] at 4091-95 (2d ed.
1991). Congress closed this "venue gap" by adding a
provision allowing suit in the district "in which the
claim arose." This phrase gave rise to a variety of
conflicting interpretations. Some courts thought it
meant that there could be only one such district; others
believed there could be several. Different tests
developed, with courts looking for "substantial
contacts," the "weight of contacts," the place of injury or
performance, or even to the boundaries of personal
jurisdiction under state law. See Moore ¶ 0.342[5.-2-1]
at 4142-45. District courts within the Second Circuit
used at least three of these approaches. See Weil v. New
York State Department of Transportation, 400 F.Supp.
1364, 1365 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (weight of contacts); Rosen
v. Savant Instruments, Inc., 264 F.Supp. 232, 237
(E.D.N.Y. 1967) (place of injury); Honda Associates, Inc.
v. Nozawa Trading, Inc., 374 F.Supp. 886, 890-92
(S.D.N.Y.1974) (discussing substantial contacts test, but
declining to adopt it since result was same under
substantial [980 F.2d 867] contacts and weight of
contacts tests).
The Supreme Court gave detailed attention to section
1391(b) in Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443
U.S. 173, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979). The
specific holding of Leroy was that Great Western, a
Texas corporation, which had attempted to take over an
Idaho corporation, could not bring suit in Texas against
Idaho officials who sought to enforce a state antitakeover
law. Although the effect of the Idaho officials'
action might be felt in Texas, the Court rejected this
factor as a basis for venue, since it would allow the
Idaho officials to be sued anywhere a shareholder of the
target corporation could allege that he wanted to accept
Great Western's tender offer. Leroy, 443 U.S. at 186, 99
S.Ct. at 2718. The Court made several further
observations: (1) the purpose of the 1966 statute was to
close venue gaps and should not be read more broadly
than necessary to close those gaps, id. at 184, 99 S.Ct. at
2717; (2) the general purpose of the venue statute was to
protect defendants against an unfair or inconvenient
trial location, id. at 183-84, 99 S.Ct. at 2716; (3) location
of evidence and witnesses was a relevant factor, id. at
186, 99 S.Ct. at 2718; (4) familiarity of the Idaho federal
judges with the Idaho anti-takeover statute was a
relevant factor, id. at 186, 99 S.Ct. at 2718; (5) plaintiff's
convenience was not a relevant factor, id. at 183, 99
S.Ct. at 2716; and (6) in only rare cases should there be
more than one district in which a claim can be said to
arise, id. at 184-85, 99 S.Ct. at 2717.
Subsequent to Leroy and prior to the 1990 amendment
to section 1391(b), most courts have applied at least a
form of the "weight of contacts" test, see, e.g., Transistor
Devices, Inc. v. Tracor, Inc., 654 F.Supp. 601, 604, 605
n. 4 (E.D.N.Y.1987). Courts continued to have difficulty
in determining whether more than one district could be
proper. See Moore ¶ 0.342[5.-2-2] at 4150-53.
Against this background, we understand Congress' 1990
amendment to be at most a marginal expansion of the
venue provision. The House Report indicates that the
new language was first proposed by the American Law
Institute in a 1969 Study, and observes:
The great advantage of referring to the place where things
happened ... is that it avoids the litigation breeding phrase "in which
the claim arose." It also avoids the problem created by the frequent
cases in which substantial parts of the underlying events have
occurred in several districts.
H.R.Rep. No. 734, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 23, reprinted in
1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6860, 6869. Thus it seems clear that
Leroy's strong admonition against recognizing multiple
venues has been disapproved. Many of the factors in
Leroy — for instance, the convenience of defendants and
the location of evidence and witnesses — are most useful
in distinguishing between two or more plausible venues.
Since the new statute does not, as a general matter,
require the District Court to determine the best venue,
these factors will be of less significance. See Magic
Toyota, Inc. v. Southeast Toyota Distributors, Inc., 784
F.Supp. 306, 316-17 (D.S.C.1992). Apart from this
point, however, Leroy and other precedents remain
important sources of guidance. See American Trade
Partners, L.P. v. A-1 International Importing
Enterprises Ltd., 757 F.Supp. 545, 557 n. 18 (E.D.Pa.
1991).
2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
Under the version of the venue statute in force from
1966 to 1990, at least three District Courts held that
venue was proper under the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act in the plaintiff's home district if a
collection agency had mailed a collection notice to an
address in that district or placed a phone call to a
number in that district. See Murphy v. Allen County
Claims & Adjustments, Inc., 550 F.Supp. 128, 130-32
(S.D.Ohio 1982); Gachette v. Tri-City Adjustment
Bureau, 519 F.Supp. 311, 313-14 (N.D.Ga.1981);
Lachman v. Bank of Louisiana in New Orleans, 510
F.Supp. 753, 760 (N.D.Ohio 1981). None of these cases
involved the unusual fact, present in this case, that the
defendant did not [980 F.2d 868] deliberately direct a
communication to the plaintiff's district.
We conclude, however, that this difference is
inconsequential, at least under the current venue statute.
The statutory standard for venue focuses not on
whether a defendant has made a deliberate contact — a
factor relevant in the analysis of personal jurisdiction1
 —
but on the location where events occurred. Under the
new version of section 1391(b)(2), we must determine
only whether a "substantial part of the events ... giving
rise to the claim" occurred in the Western District of
New York.
In adopting this statute, Congress was concerned about
the harmful effect of abusive debt practices on
consumers. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692(a) ("Abusive debt
collection practices contribute to the number of
personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss
of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy."). This
harm does not occur until receipt of the collection
notice. Indeed, if the notice were lost in the mail, it is
unlikely that a violation of the Act would have
occurred.2 Moreover, a debt collection agency sends its
dunning letters so that they will be received.
Forwarding such letters to the district to which a debtor
has moved is an important step in the collection process.
If the bill collector prefers not to be challenged for its
collection practices outside the district of a debtor's
original residence, the envelope can be marked "do not
forward." We conclude that receipt of a collection notice
is a substantial part of the events giving rise to a claim
under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
The relevant factors identified in Leroy add support to
our conclusion. Although "bona fide error" can be a
defense to liability under the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(c),
the alleged violations of the Act turn largely not on the
collection agency's intent, but on the content of the
collection notice. The most relevant evidence — the
collection notice — is located in the Western District of
New York. Because the collection agency appears not to
have marked the notice with instructions not to
forward, and has not objected to the assertion of
personal jurisdiction, trial in the Western District of
New York would not be unfair.
Conclusion
The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the
matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this decision.
