The central question presented by this appeal is whether
a court may dismiss an action for failure to join an
indispensable party, notwithstanding defendant's ability
to join the party in question by asserting a compulsory
counterclaim against it. Plaintiff-appellant Associated
Dry Goods Corp. ("Associated") appeals from a
judgment, entered in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Robert W.
Sweet, Judge), dismissing its complaint for failure to join
an indispensable party.
Associated initiated this action against defendantappellee
Towers Financial Corporation ("Towers") to
recover damages for Towers' failure to pay rent as
required by a sublease agreement. In addition,
Associated sought to obtain a declaratory judgment
regarding the extent of its obligation to provide Towers
with electrical service. In response, Towers moved to
dismiss the complaint for failure to join an indispensable
party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(7). Towers argued that the suit
must be dismissed since joinder of the building's
landlord, 417 Fifth Avenue Corp. ("417 Fifth") — which
was required in order to afford the parties complete
relief — would strip the court of diversity jurisdiction.
This motion was granted by the district court.
On appeal, Associated contends that because 417 Fifth
was not a party to the sublease, it was neither a
necessary nor an indispensable party to this action. In
the alternative, Associated argues that Towers' ability to
join 417 Fifth as a party — by asserting a compulsory
counterclaim against it — precludes the court from
dismissing the action "in equity and good conscience."
See Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). For the reasons set forth below,
the judgment of the district court is reversed and the
action is remanded for further proceedings.
BACKGROUND
Associated is a Virginia corporation with its principal
place of business in St. Louis, Missouri. Since 1980
Associated has leased office space in a building located at
417 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. The lessor of
this building, 417 Fifth, is a New York resident, having
its principal place of business in New York.
In June 1987, Towers, a Nevada corporation with its
principal place of business in New York, began leasing
the ninth floor of the building at 417 Fifth from
Associated. Subsequently, on January 19, 1988, Towers
and Associated entered into an additional sublease
agreement allocating to Towers space on the seventh
and eighth floors of the building. On the same date, 417
Fifth signed a consent to sublease agreement with
Associated and Towers, in which it agreed not to
unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any
alterations proposed by Towers, the subtenant.
Shortly after taking possession of the seventh and eighth
floors, Towers determined that the existing electrical
service on these floors was inadequate to serve its needs.
Consequently, Towers approached Associated and the
parties agreed to allow Towers to use 150 amps of
power from the building's sixth floor. The parties
submitted this agreement to 417 Fifth for its approval.
Before 417 Fifth would approve this arrangement,
however, it requested that the parties submit a
schematic plan detailing the structural changes that
would have to be made in order to divert the electrical
power. To prepare this plan, Towers' engineer needed
access to the building's basement. However, 417 Fifth
denied Towers permission to survey the basement in
which the electrical apparatus was located.
On July 5, 1988, Towers initiated an action against 417
Fifth in New York State Supreme Court seeking an
order to show cause requiring 417 Fifth to consent to
the proposed alterations and to grant Towers access to
the basement. On the same day, Towers requested that
Associated allocate an additional 200 amps of electrical
power to the seventh and eighth floors.
Two months later, in September 1988, Towers agreed
to discontinue its state court action in exchange for
Associated's written promise that it would support
Towers in the pursuit of its rights under the [920 F.2d
1123] sublease documents. By letter dated September 6,
1988, Associated agreed that
[i]f [the] Overlandlord [417 Fifth] has not responded reasonably to
said plans and specifications submission within 45 days of the date
of submission ... then Associated will support Towers in the pursuit
of Towers' rights under the Sublease documents so long as and
provided that Towers has not caused a material default with regard
to its obligations under the Sublease documents.
Joint Appendix at A-76.
Subsequently, Towers and Associated submitted a letter
to 417 Fifth detailing proposed alterations. After
reviewing the submitted plans and determining that
they were incomplete, 417 Fifth withheld its consent to
the proposed modifications. Despite this refusal to
consent, on November 30, 1988, Towers requested that
Associated divert an additional 250 amps of electrical
current to the seventh and eighth floors. The parties'
efforts to conclude an agreement to accomplish this was
interrupted, however, by Associated's initiation of this
lawsuit.
From the beginning of the sublease term, Towers has
refused to pay rent, claiming that it has not been able to
use the subleased space as intended. In addition, Towers
has failed to pay rent for the space on the ninth floor,
although this space is being used as planned.
Consequently, Associated commenced this action
against Towers, seeking a declaratory judgment that
Towers has breached the sublease agreement as well as
damages arising from this breach. Towers moved to
dismiss the action, alleging that 417 Fifth was an
indispensable party that if joined would destroy
complete diversity, thereby divesting the court of
jurisdiction. Associated cross-moved for summary
judgment in its favor. The district court granted
Towers' motion to dismiss and denied Associated's
cross-motion for summary judgment. This appeal
followed.
During the pendency of the Rule 12(b) and summary
judgment motions, Towers initiated a state court action
joining both Associated and 417 Fifth as defendants.
That action has progressed and is now in the discovery
stage.
DISCUSSION
Associated argues that because Towers has the ability to
join 417 Fifth by asserting a compulsory counterclaim
against it, the court cannot in equity and good
conscience dismiss the suit for failure to join an
indispensable party. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h);
Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. We agree.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 sets forth a two step inquiry for
determining whether an action must be dismissed for
failure to join an indispensable party. The first prong of
the test focuses on whether the party should be joined if
feasible. Rule 19(a) provides in pertinent part:
A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will
not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's
absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already
parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of
the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the
person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the
person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the
persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring
double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of
the claimed interest.
Unless Rule 19(a)'s threshold standard is met, the court
need not consider whether dismissal under Rule 19(b) is
warranted.
The district court found that 417 Fifth was a necessary
party under Rule 19(a). The court based its decision on
Towers' assertion in its motion to dismiss that if 417
Fifth was not joined Towers would be unable to obtain
"full relief" on counterclaims it intended to bring against
Associated and 417 Fifth. The court noted: "According
to Towers' proposed answer and counterclaims, unless
the Landlord is compelled to change its course and to act
on the plans submitted, Towers will never be able to
enjoy quietly the premises it had leased [920 F.2d 1124]
from A[ssociated]." Associated Dry Goods Corp. v.
Towers Fin. Corp., 127 F.R.D. 57, 61 (S.D.N.Y.1989).
It is troubling that the district court reached its
conclusion by considering Towers' "putative answer"
and proposed, but not yet pled, third-party claims.
Indeed, it is the general rule that a court considering
"whether [an] absent person's interest in the litigation is
sufficient to satisfy ... the first sentence of Rule 19(a) ...
must base its decision on the pleadings as they appear at
the time of the proposed joinder." C. Wright & A.
Miller, 7 Federal Practice & Procedure § 1604, at 40
(1986); see La Chemise Lacoste v. General Mills, Inc., 53
F.R.D. 596, 601 (D.Del.1971), aff'd, 487 F.2d 312 (3rd
Cir.1973); cf. Halpern v. Rosenbloom, 459 F.Supp. 1346,
1354 (S.D.N.Y.1978) ("[P]laintiffs are not required to
anticipate defendant's counterclaims and join all parties
that may be necessary for defendant's benefit.").
Nevertheless, we accept for present purposes that 417
Fifth's inclusion in the action is necessary in order to
afford complete relief to the parties. 417 Fifth may be
considered a party to be joined if feasible under Rule
19(a), since without 417 Fifth, Towers would not be
able to obtain full injunctive relief on any counterclaim
it asserts against Associated to increase electrical
capacity. For example, if 417 Fifth is not made a party,
the court could not compel Associated to increase the
amperage supplied to the seventh and eighth floors, for
Associated cannot allocate this electricity without 417
Fifth's consent. Moreover, Towers' defenses to
Associated's action to collect rent are based, in part, on
417 Fifth's alleged failure to comply with the consent to
sublease agreement. Therefore, if the action were to
proceed in 417 Fifth's absence, Towers might be forced
to bring an additional state court action against 417
Fifth in order to obtain full relief. Thus, under Rule
19(a), 417 Fifth is a party that should be joined if
feasible. Associated cannot join 417 Fifth as a party to
the action, however, because the addition of 417 Fifth, a
non-diverse party, would destroy complete diversity and
strip the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over
the suit.
Accordingly, the court must proceed to the second step
of the indispensable party analysis, which requires it to
assess whether or not, in equity and good conscience,
the action should proceed in the necessary party's
absence. Rule 19(b) enumerates four relevant
considerations to guide the court's judgment:
[F]irst, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence
might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second,
the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by
the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be
lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the
person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will
have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for non-joinder.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). Upon assessing these factors, the
district court concluded that the action should be
dismissed. We disagree.
The drafters of Rule 19(b) did not assign relative weight
to each of the factors enumerated in the Rule. Instead,
the Rule allows courts themselves to determine the
emphasis to be placed on each consideration according
to "the facts of [the] given case and in light of the
governing equity-and-good-conscience test." C. Wright
& A. Miller, 7 Federal Practice and Procedure § 1608, at
91-92. In this case, we view as dispositive Towers'
ability to avoid all prejudice to itself by asserting a
compulsory counterclaim against Associated pursuant to
Rule 13(a) and adding 417 Fifth as a party to the
counterclaim under Rule 13(h). See Abel v. Brayton
Flying Serv., 248 F.2d 713 (5th Cir.1957); see also Boone
v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 682 F.2d 552, 553
(5th Cir.1982) (absent party not indispensable when
defendant may implead that party); Pasco Int'l (London)
Ltd. v. Stenograph Corp., 637 F.2d 496, 503, 505 (7th
Cir.1980) (parties who may be impleaded under Rule 14
are never indispensable under Rule 19(b)). Towers'
putative claims against Associated [920 F.2d 1125] all
arise out of the transactions forming the subject matter
of the instant case and are, therefore, compulsory. See
Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a); Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor
Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1202 (2d Cir.1970); see also CrouseHinds
Co. v. Internorth, Inc., 634 F.2d 690, 700 (2d
Cir.1980) ("`Transaction is a word of flexible meaning ...
that [a] counterclaim embraces additional allegations ...
does not matter.'") (quoting Moore v. New York Cotton
Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 610, 46 S.Ct. 367, 371, 70 L.Ed.
750 (1926)). Because we believe that "the Rule 19(b)
notion of equity and good conscience contemplates that
the parties actually before the court are obliged to
pursue any avenues for eliminating the threat of
prejudice," we find that the action cannot be dismissed
under Rule 19. C. Wright & A. Miller, 7 Federal Practice
& Procedure § 1608, at 112-13 (emphasis added).
Towers contends that it may not assert counterclaims
against 417 Fifth because, in light of Finley v. United
States, 490 U.S. 545, 109 S.Ct. 2003, 104 L.Ed.2d 593
(1989), the district court would lack jurisdiction over
those claims. Prior to the Finley decision, it was wellsettled
that when diversity between parties is lacking, a
court could assert ancillary jurisdiction over an
additional party joined to a compulsory counterclaim
pursuant to Rule 13(h). See Newburger, Loeb & Co. v.
Gross, 563 F.2d 1057, 1070 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied,
434 U.S. 1035, 98 S.Ct. 769, 54 L.Ed.2d 782 (1978);
United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Prods. Inc., 221
F.2d 213 (2d Cir.1955); see also Crouse-Hinds Co. v.
Internorth, Inc., 634 F.2d 690, 699 (2d Cir.1980). We
believe that Finley does not invalidate this widely
accepted practice.
Finley was initially brought as a Federal Tort Claims Act
suit ("FTCA"), 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b), against the Federal
Aviation Administration ("FAA"). Plaintiff's husband
and two children were killed when their plane struck
electric transmission lines on its approach to a San
Diego airfield. The plaintiff, alleging that the FAA was
negligent in operating and maintaining the runway
lights, initiated a federal proceeding against it.
Subsequently, plaintiff moved to amend her complaint
to include claims against two other defendants, the San
Diego Gas & Electric Company and the City of San
Diego, arising out of the same accident. Plaintiff relied
on the court's pendent jurisdiction to support these
additional claims. The Supreme Court, noting that the
FTCA contained a narrow statutory jurisdictional grant,
held that a federal court adjudicating a matter under the
FTCA could not exercise pendent jurisdiction over
additional parties where no independent basis of
jurisdiction exists. Id. 109 S.Ct. at 2007-08. See Roco
Carriers, Ltd. v. M/V Nurnberg Express, 899 F.2d 1292,
1295 (2d Cir.1990); Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899,
905-06 (1st Cir.1989); cf. Staffer v. Bouchard Transp.
Co., 878 F.2d 638, 643 n. 5 (2d Cir.1989).
In dictum, the Finley Court stated that a federal court
may assert ancillary jurisdiction "in a narrow class of
cases." Finley, 109 S.Ct. at 2008. Drawing on this phrase,
Towers argues that the Supreme Court intended to
disapprove of federal courts' invocation of ancillary
jurisdiction in cases involving compulsory
counterclaims. See C. Wright & A. Miller, 7 Federal
Practice & Procedure § 1436, at 276 (1990) (suggesting
that Finley raises doubt as to the viability of ancillary
jurisdiction in third party actions); see also Community
Coffee Co., Inc. v. M/S Kriti Amethyst, 715 F.Supp. 772,
773 (E.D.La.1989). Although Finley circumscribed
pendent party jurisdiction, we believe that the Court's
language in Finley did not signal a retreat from
established third-party practices.
In Finley, the Court emphasized that the posture of the
claims asserted must be examined, 109 S.Ct. at 2007, and
placed great reliance on the fact that the plaintiff added
claims involving new parties whose only connection
with the suit was that the claims against them "derive[d]
from a common nucleus of operative fact" as the initial
claim. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715,
725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).
According to the Court, this connection was too
tenuous to support the exercise of pendent jurisdiction
over the additional claims.
[920 F.2d 1126] Compulsory counterclaims over which a
court is willing to exercise ancillary jurisdiction
generally arise in a different posture. In this case, for
example, it is the defendant, not the plaintiff, that would
seek to join a third party as a Rule 13(h) counterclaim
defendant. As the Supreme Court recognized in Owen
Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 98
S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978), ancillary jurisdiction
should be more readily available to one haled into court
against his or her will than to a plaintiff who has chosen
the forum for litigation. Id. at 376, 98 S.Ct. at 2404.
Moreover, the Supreme Court noted in Owen that "[a]
third-party complaint depends at least in part upon the
resolution of the primary lawsuit. Its relation to the
original complaint is thus not mere factual similarity but
logical dependence." Id. (citation omitted). The federal
courts' longstanding practice of allowing permissive
joinder of parties and claims stands in opposition to the
broad reading of Finley that Towers urges in this case.
Indeed, "Congress did not intend to confine the
jurisdiction of federal courts so inflexibly that they are
unable to protect legal rights or effectively to resolve an
entire, logically entwined lawsuit. Those practical needs
are the basis of ancillary jurisdiction." Id. at 377, 98 S.Ct.
at 2404. Therefore, we find that Finley does not bar the
district court from exercising ancillary jurisdiction over
any Rule 13(h) counterclaim that Towers asserts against
417 Fifth. See King Fisher Marine Serv. v. 21st Phoenix
Corp., 893 F.2d 1155, 1161 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, ___
U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 2603, 110 L.Ed.2d 283 (1990); see
also Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. C and A
Currency Exchange, Inc., 738 F.Supp. 302, 304
(N.D.Ill.1990) ("court hence hesitates to seize upon
Finley's ambiguous statement in order to `roll back' the
entire area of federal jurisdiction over third-party
claims"); Huberman v. Duane Fellows, Inc., 725 F.Supp.
204, 207 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (court "does not read Finley as
threatening jurisdiction over impleaded third-party
defendants.").
Finally, Towers contends that the pendency of the state
court suit renders the exercise of federal jurisdiction
unnecessary and requests this Court to dismiss this
action without prejudice, or to stay the action, pending
resolution of the parallel state court action. See
Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483
(1976). In assessing whether to dismiss or stay an action
under Colorado River a court should consider: (1) the
inconvenience of the federal forum; (2) the desirability
of avoiding piecemeal litigation; and (3) the order in
which the concurrent actions were initiated. Id. at 818,
96 S.Ct. at 1246. See Arkwright-Boston Mfrs. Mut. Ins.
Co. v. New York, 762 F.2d 205, 210 (2d Cir.1985). In
this case, the federal forum is equally convenient and the
federal suit was instituted prior to the state court suit.
Moreover, after this action is reinstated, the parties may
move to dismiss the state court suit and avoid
"piecemeal" litigation. We find, therefore, that this
argument is without merit.
CONCLUSION
We have examined each of defendant-appellee's
remaining arguments and find them to be without
merit. In light of the foregoing, the district court's
judgment is reversed and the action is remanded for
further proceedings.
