Lachonne Bell appeals the grant of summary judgment
by the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Arkansas in this diversity case in which she
sought payment under two accidental death insurance
policies upon the death of her ex-husband. Bell also
appeals the district court's denial of her motion to
amend her complaint. We affirm.
I.
Lachonne Bell purchased two insurance policies from
Allstate Life Insurance Company (Allstate) under master
group policies. Sears Roebuck & Company (Sears) was
the policyholder in each case. One policy was an
Accidental Death and Dismemberment policy, effective
January 11, 1994, and the other was an Accidental Death
policy, effective March 17, 1994. Both policies listed
Lachonne Bell as the primary insured and defined
"insured person" to include "you" (defined as the
primary insured) and "if covered, your spouse."
Lachonne Bell married Earl Bell on July 31, 1983. They
were divorced on December 8, 1994, and Earl Bell died
on June 30, 1995. Lachonne Bell filed a claim under both
policies but was denied coverage because she was not
married to Earl at the time of his death and thus, he was
not her spouse and not covered under the policies.
On March 20, 1997, Bell filed this diversity action to
recover on the policies. Defendants moved for summary
judgment on October 24, 1997, the last day for filing
motions under the court's scheduling order. Bell filed a
motion to amend her original complaint on October 30,
1997, four working days after the court's motion cutoff
deadline, seeking to add allegations that Allstate had
illegally marketed the policies and that the policies
violated Arkansas law by not including a conversion
privilege. The district court denied the motion to amend
and granted summary judgment [160 F.3d 454] in favor
of the defendants on November 26, 1997.
II.
A. Leave to Amend Complaint
Bell argues that the district court abused its discretion by
denying her motion to amend her complaint. A decision
whether to allow a party to amend her complaint is left
to the sound discretion of the district court and should
be overruled only if there is an abuse of discretion. See
Humphreys v. Roche Biomedical Labs., Inc., 990 F.2d
1078, 1081 (8th Cir.1993); Buder v. Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 644 F.2d 690, 694 (8th
Cir.1981). After an answer has been filed in response to
the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff "may amend the
party's pleading only by leave of court ... and leave shall
be freely given when justice so requires." Fed.R.Civ.P.
15(a). Proper justification for denying such a motion
includes: "undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on
the part of the movant, ... undue prejudice to the
opposing party by virtue of allowance of the
amendment, [and] futility of amendment." Foman v.
Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222
(1962). Delay alone is insufficient justification; prejudice
to the nonmovant must also be shown. See Buder, 644
F.2d at 694 (finding that delay coupled with a mere
recitation of prejudice by the district court was
insufficient to pass scrutiny); Mercantile Trust Co. Nat'l
Ass'n v. Inland Marine Prods. Corp., 542 F.2d 1010,
1012 (8th Cir.1976) (holding that delay alone is not
enough to deny a motion to amend). Any prejudice to
the nonmovant must be weighed against the prejudice
to the moving party by not allowing the amendment.
Buder, 644 F.2d at 694.
Bell filed her motion four working days after the motion
cutoff date, certainly not late enough alone to be
prejudicial. However, it was also after the discovery
deadline and five weeks before trial. While the original
complaint sought payment on the policies, the
amendment alleged illegal activity in the marketing of
the policies as well as violations of Arkansas law
regarding the content of the policies. Cases in which an
abuse of discretion has been found generally involve
amendments based on facts similar to the original
complaint. See Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 823 F.2d 214,
216-17 (8th Cir.1987) (finding abuse of discretion where
a party was not allowed to amend his complaint to
properly plead diversity as the basis for jurisdiction);
Buder, 644 F.2d at 694-95 & n. 5 (finding abuse where a
plaintiff was not allowed to amend his complaint to
plead fraud based on facts substantially similar to his
previously pled securities law claim). On the other hand,
when late tendered amendments involve new theories
of recovery and impose additional discovery
requirements, courts are less likely to find an abuse of
discretion due to the prejudice involved. See Dover
Elevator Co. v. Arkansas State Univ., 64 F.3d 442, 448
(8th Cir.1995) (finding no abuse of discretion where
trial was less than a month away, the discovery deadline
was within a week of the motion to amend, and the
amendment, adding a new theory of recovery, would
leave the opposing party inadequate time to prepare);
Vitale v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 814 F.2d 1242, 1252 (8th
Cir.1987) (finding no abuse where the motion was made
less than two months before trial, no reason was given
for the delay, and the amendment may have required
additional discovery on the new factual allegations). The
amendments sought in this case would require
additional discovery by the parties. They would require
a review of the marketing of the policies as well as an
evaluation of specific provisions of the policies for
compliance with Arkansas insurance law. The district
court found that if it allowed the amendment, it would
require an extension of the already expired deadline for
motions. The issues raised by the proposed amendment
involve different factual and legal issues than the
allegations in the original complaint.
The district court denied Bell's motion because of undue
delay, prejudice to the defendants in having to reopen
discovery on new substantive claims so close to the trial
date, and because the only reason for the untimeliness of
the motion was Bell's lack of due diligence. Bell argues
that her new claims have merit and she will be greatly
prejudiced if the amendment is denied because the new
claims are her only hope for victory on the [160 F.3d
455] merits. While this may or may not be true, the
district court provided adequate justification for its
ruling.
Bell also argues the district court should have reopened
discovery in lieu of denying the motion. It is within the
district court's discretion to extend discovery, grant a
continuance, or require the moving party to compensate
the opposing party for any losses caused by allowing the
amendment. See Buder, 644 F.2d at 694. But it is just
that â€” the district court's discretion. We are unable to
say on these facts that the district court abused its
discretion in denying Bell's motion to amend her
complaint.
B. Summary Judgment
Bell appeals the district court's grant of summary
judgment on her claims as originally filed, arguing that
the alleged illegal activities of the defendants in relation
to the insurance policies raise a genuine issue of material
fact regarding her recovery under the policies. We
review a grant of summary judgment de novo, see
Dupps v. Travelers Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 312, 313 (8th
Cir.1996), viewing the record in the light most favorable
to Bell, the nonmoving party. Summary judgment is
appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material
fact in the record and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548,
91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).
State law controls the construction of insurance policies
when a federal court is exercising diversity jurisdiction.
Langley v. Allstate Ins. Co., 995 F.2d 841, 844 (8th
Cir.1993) (citations omitted). We review the district
court's interpretation of Arkansas law de novo. Dupps,
80 F.3d at 313. Arkansas courts follow a long-standing
rule that the language of an insurance policy controls if
the terms are clear and unambiguous. Courts refuse to
rewrite the policy to make an insurer liable for a risk
that is plainly excluded. See Vincent v. Prudential Ins.
Brokerage, 333 Ark. 414, 970 S.W.2d 215, 216
(Ark.1998); Smith v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 327 Ark.
208, 937 S.W.2d 180, 181-82 (1997). Words are to be
construed in their "plain, ordinary, popular sense."
Langley, 995 F.2d at 844-45 (internal quotations
omitted).
Both policies in question name Lachonne Bell as the
"primary insured." The Certificate of Insurance defines
"primary insured" to be "you, the individual named on
the certificate," and defines "insured person" to be "you,
and if covered, your spouse." There is nothing
ambiguous about this language, taken in its ordinary
sense. See WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW
INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2208 (1986)
(defining "spouse" as a "man or woman joined in
wedlock: married person: husband, wife"). Lachonne
and Earl Bell were divorced December 8, 1994. Earl Bell
died June 30, 1995. Earl Bell was not an "insured person"
under either policy since he was neither the individual
named on the certificate nor the spouse of that person at
the time of his death. Because there is no genuine issue
of material fact regarding the coverage of Earl Bell,
summary judgment was appropriate.
Bell argues that summary judgment was inappropriate
because, as she alleges, the insurance policies were
illegally marketed and violated various Arkansas
statutes. Because the district court denied her request to
amend the complaint, which we affirm, these claims are
not part of the record, see Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c), and are
not considered when determining the summary
judgment motion.
III.
For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of
the district court.
