These cases arise out of an air crash that took place in
Scotland. Respondent, acting as representative of the
estates of several Scottish citizens killed in the accident,
brought wrongful-death actions against petitioners that
were ultimately transferred to the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
Petitioners moved to dismiss on the ground of forum
non conveniens. After noting that an alternative forum
existed in Scotland, the District Court granted their
motions. 479 F.Supp. 727 (1979). The United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 630
F.2d 149 (1980). The Court of Appeals based its
decision, at least in part, on the ground that dismissal is
automatically barred where the law of the alternative
forum is less favorable to the plaintiff than the law of the
forum chosen by the plaintiff. Because we conclude that
the possibility of an unfavorable change in law should
not, by itself, bar dismissal, and because we conclude
that the District Court did not otherwise abuse its
discretion, we reverse.
I
A
In July 1976, a small commercial aircraft crashed in the
Scottish highlands during the course of a charter flight
from [454 U.S. 239] Blackpool to Perth. The pilot and
five passengers were killed instantly. The decedents
were all Scottish subjects and residents, as are their heirs
and next of kin. There were no eyewitnesses to the
accident. At the time of the crash the plane was subject
to Scottish air traffic control.
The aircraft, a twin-engine Piper Aztec, was
manufactured in Pennsylvania by petitioner Piper
Aircraft Co. (Piper). The propellers were manufactured
in Ohio by petitioner Hartzell Propeller, Inc. (Hartzell).
At the time of the crash the aircraft was registered in
Great Britain and was owned and maintained by Air
Navigation and Trading Co., Ltd. (Air Navigation). It
was operated by McDonald Aviation, Ltd. (McDonald),
a Scottish air taxi service. Both Air Navigation and
McDonald were organized in the United Kingdom. The
wreckage of the plane is now in a hangar in
Farnsborough, England.
The British Department of Trade investigated the
accident shortly after it occurred. A preliminary report
found that the plane crashed after developing a spin, and
suggested that mechanical failure in the plane or the
propeller was responsible. At Hartzell's request, this
report was reviewed by a three-member Review Board,
which held a 9-day adversary hearing attended by all
interested parties. The Review Board found no evidence
of defective equipment and indicated that pilot error
may have contributed to the accident. The pilot, who
had obtained his commercial pilot's license only three
months earlier, was flying over high ground at an
altitude considerably lower than the minimum height
required by his company's operations manual.
In July 1977, a California probate court appointed
respondent Gaynell Reyno administratrix of the estates
of the five passengers. Reyno is not related to and does
not know any of the decedents or their survivors; she
was a legal secretary to the attorney who filed this
lawsuit. Several days after her appointment, Reyno
commenced separate wrongful-death [454 U.S. 240]
actions against Piper and Hartzell in the Superior Court
of California, claiming negligence and strict liability.1
Air Navigation, McDonald, and the estate of the pilot
are not parties to this litigation. The survivors of the
five passengers whose estates are represented by Reyno
filed a separate action in the United Kingdom against
Air Navigation, McDonald, and the pilot's estate.2
Reyno candidly admits that the action against Piper and
Hartzell was filed in the United States because its laws
regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are
more favorable to her position than are those of
Scotland. Scottish law does not recognize strict liability
in tort. Moreover, it permits wrongful-death actions
only when brought by a decedent's relatives. The
relatives may sue only for "loss of support and society."3
On petitioners' motion, the suit was removed to the
United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Piper then moved for transfer to the United
States District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1404(a).4
Hartzell moved to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to transfer.5 In
December 1977, the District Court quashed service on
[454 U.S. 241] Hartzell and transferred the case to the
Middle District of Pennsylvania. Respondent then
properly served process on Hartzell.
B
In May 1978, after the suit had been transferred, both
Hartzell and Piper moved to dismiss the action on the
ground of forum non conveniens. The District Court
granted these motions in October 1979. It relied on the
balancing test set forth by this Court in Gulf Oil Corp. v.
Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501 (1947), and its companion case,
Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518
(1947). In those decisions, the Court stated that a
plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.
However, when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to
hear the case, and when trial in the chosen forum would
"establish . . . oppressiveness and vexation to a
defendant. . . out of all proportion to plaintiff's
convenience," or when the "chosen forum [is]
inappropriate because of considerations affecting the
court's own administrative and legal problems," the
court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion,
dismiss the case. Koster, supra, at 524. To guide trial
court discretion, the Court provided a list of "private
interest factors" affecting the convenience of the
litigants, and a list of "public interest factors" affecting
the convenience of the forum. Gilbert, supra, at 508-
509.6
[454 U.S. 242] After describing our decisions in Gilbert
and Koster, the District Court analyzed the facts of these
cases. It began by observing that an alternative forum
existed in Scotland; Piper and Hartzell had agreed to
submit to the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts and to
waive any statute of limitations defense that might be
available. It then stated that plaintiff's choice of forum
was entitled to little weight. The court recognized that a
plaintiff's choice ordinarily deserves substantial
deference. It noted, however, that Reyno "is a
representative of foreign citizens and residents seeking a
forum in the United States because of the more liberal
rules concerning products liability law," and that "the
courts have been less solicitous when the plaintiff is not
an American citizen or resident, and particularly when
the foreign citizens seek to benefit from the more liberal
tort rules provided for the protection of citizens and
residents of the United States." 479 F. Supp., at 731.
The District Court next examined several factors
relating to the private interests of the litigants, and
determined that these factors strongly pointed towards
Scotland as the appropriate forum. Although evidence
concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the
plane and propeller is located in the United States, the
connections with Scotland are otherwise
"overwhelming." Id., at 732. The real parties in interest
are citizens of Scotland, as were all the decedents.
Witnesses who could testify regarding the maintenance
of the aircraft, the training of the pilot, and the
investigation of the accident — all essential to the
defense — are in Great Britain. Moreover, all witnesses
to damages are located in Scotland. Trial would be aided
by familiarity with Scottish topography, and by easy
access to the wreckage.
The District Court reasoned that because crucial
witnesses and evidence were beyond the reach of
compulsory process, and because the defendants would
not be able to implead potential Scottish third-party
defendants, it would be "unfair to make Piper and
Hartzell proceed to trial in this forum." Id., [454 U.S.
243] at 733. The survivors had brought separate actions
in Scotland against the pilot, McDonald, and Air
Navigation. "[I]t would be fairer to all parties and less
costly if the entire case was presented to one jury with
available testimony from all relevant witnesses." Ibid.
Although the court recognized that if trial were held in
the United States, Piper and Hartzell could file
indemnity or contribution actions against the Scottish
defendants, it believed that there was a significant risk of
inconsistent verdicts.7
The District Court concluded that the relevant public
interests also pointed strongly towards dismissal. The
court determined that Pennsylvania law would apply to
Piper and Scottish law to Hartzell if the case were tried
in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.8 As a result,
"trial in this forum would be hopelessly complex and
confusing for a jury." Id., at 734. In addition, the court
noted that it was unfamiliar with Scottish law and thus
would have to rely upon experts from that country. The
court also found that the trial would be enormously
costly and time-consuming; that it would be unfair to
burden citizens with jury duty when the Middle District
[454 U.S. 244] of Pennsylvania has little connection with
the controversy; and that Scotland has a substantial
interest in the outcome of the litigation.
In opposing the motions to dismiss, respondent
contended that dismissal would be unfair because
Scottish law was less favorable. The District Court
explicitly rejected this claim. It reasoned that the
possibility that dismissal might lead to an unfavorable
change in the law did not deserve significant weight; any
deficiency in the foreign law was a "matter to be dealt
with in the foreign forum." Id., at 738.
C
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit reversed and remanded for trial. The
decision to reverse appears to be based on two
alternative grounds. First, the Court held that the
District Court abused its discretion in conducting the
Gilbert analysis. Second, the Court held that dismissal is
never appropriate where the law of the alternative
forum is less favorable to the plaintiff.
The Court of Appeals began its review of the District
Court's Gilbert analysis by noting that the plaintiff's
choice of forum deserved substantial weight, even
though the real parties in interest are nonresidents. It
then rejected the District Court's balancing of the
private interests. It found that Piper and Hartzell had
failed adequately to support their claim that key
witnesses would be unavailable if trial were held in the
United States: they had never specified the witnesses
they would call and the testimony these witnesses would
provide. The Court of Appeals gave little weight to the
fact that piper and Hartzell would not be able to implead
potential Scottish third-party defendants, reasoning that
this difficulty would be "burdensome" but not "unfair,"
630 F. 2d, at 162.9 Finally, the court stated that
resolution of the suit [454 U.S. 245] would not be
significantly aided by familiarity with Scottish
topography, or by viewing the wreckage.
The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court's
analysis of the public interest factors. It found that the
District Court gave undue emphasis to the application of
Scottish law: " `the mere fact that the court is called
upon to determine and apply foreign law does not
present a legal problem of the sort which would justify
the dismissal of a case otherwise properly before the
court.' " Id., at 163 (quoting Hoffman v. Goberman, 420
F.2d 423, 427 (CA3 1970)). In any event, it believed that
Scottish law need not be applied. After conducting its
own choice-of-law analysis, the Court of Appeals
determined that American law would govern the actions
against both Piper and Hartzell.10 The same choice-oflaw
analysis apparently led it to conclude that
Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Scotland, are the
jurisdictions with the greatest policy interests in the
dispute, and that all other public interest factors favored
trial in the United States.11
[454 U.S. 246] In any event, it appears that the Court of
Appeals would have reversed even if the District Court
had properly balanced the public and private interests.
The court stated:
"[I]t is apparent that the dismissal would work a change in the
applicable law so that the plaintiff's strict liability claim would be
eliminated from the case. But . . . a dismissal for forum non
conveniens, like a statutory transfer, `should not, despite its
convenience, result in a change in the applicable law.' Only when
American law is not applicable, or when the foreign jurisdiction
would, as a matter of its won choice of law, give the plaintiff the
benefit of the claim to which she is entitled here, would dismissal be
justified." 630 F. 2d, at 163-164 (footnote omitted) (quoting
DeMateos v. Texaco, Inc., 562 F.2d 895, 899 (CA3 1977), cert.
denied, 435 U.S. 904 (1978)).
In other words, the court decided that dismissal is
automatically barred if it would lead to a change in the
applicable law unfavorable to the plaintiff.
We granted certiorari in these case to consider the
questions they raise concerning the proper application
of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. 450 U.S. 909
(1981).12
[454 U.S. 247] II
The Court of Appeals erred in holding that plaintiffs
may defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of forum
non conveniens merely by showing that the substantive
law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less
favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the present forum.
The possibility of a change in substantive law should
ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial
weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry.
We expressly rejected the position adopted by the Court
of Appeals in our decision in Canada Malting Co. v.
Paterson Steamships, Ltd., 285 U.S. 413 (1932). That
case arose out of a collision between two vessels in
American waters. The Canadian owners of cargo lost in
the accident sued the Canadian owners of one of the
vessels in Federal District Court. The cargo owners
chose an American court in large part because the
relevant American liability rules were more favorable
than the Canadian rules. The District Court dismissed
on grounds of forum non conveniens. The plaintiffs
argued that dismissal was inappropriate because
Canadian laws were less favorable to them. This Court
nonetheless affirmed:
"We have no occasion to enquire by what law rights of the parties
are governed, as we are of the opinion [454 U.S. 248] that, under
any view of that question, it lay within the discretion of the District
Court to decline to assume jurisdiction over the controversy. . . .
`[T]he court will not take cognizance of the case if justice would be
as well done by remitting the parties to their home forum.' " Id., at
419-420 (quoting Charter Shipping Co. v. Bowring, Jones & Tidy,
Ltd., 281 U.S. 515, 517 (1930).
The Court further stated that "[t]here was no basis for
the contention that the District Court abused its
discretion." 285 U. S., at 423.
It is true that Canada Malting was decided before
Gilbert, and that the doctrine of forum non conveniens
was not fully crystallized until our decision in that case.13
However, Gilbert in no way affects the validity of
Canada Malting. Indeed, [454 U.S. 249] by holding that
the central focus of the forum non conveniens inquiry is
convenience, Gilbert implicitly recognized that dismissal
may not be barred solely because of the possibility of an
unfavorable change in law.14 Under Gilbert, dismissal
will ordinarily be appropriate where trial in the
plaintiff's chosen forum imposes a heavy burden on the
defendant or the court, and where the plaintiff is unable
to offer any specific reasons of convenience supporting
his choice.15 If substantial weight were given to the
possibility of an unfavorable change in law, however,
dismissal might be barred even where trial in the chosen
forum was plainly inconvenient.
The Court of Appeals' decision is inconsistent with this
Court's earlier forum non conveniens decisions in
another respect. Those decisions have repeatedly
emphasized the need to retain flexibility. In Gilbert, the
Court refused to identify specific circumstances "which
will justify or require either grant or denial of remedy."
330 U. S., at 508. Similarly, in Koster, the Court rejected
the contention that where a trial would involve inquiry
into the internal affairs of a foreign corporation,
dismissal was always appropriate. "That is one, but only
one, factor which may show convenience." 330 U. S., at
527. And in Williams v. Green Bay & Western R. Co.,
326 U.S. 549, 557 (1946), we stated that we would not
lay down a rigid rule to govern discretion, and that
"[e]ach case turns on its facts." If central emphasis were
[454 U.S. 250] placed on any one factor, the forum non
conveniens doctrine would lose much of the very
flexibility that makes it so valuable.
In fact, if conclusive or substantial weight were given to
the possibility of a change in law, the forum non
conveniens doctrine would become virtually useless.
Jurisdiction and venue requirements are often easily
satisfied. As a result, many plaintiffs are able to choose
from among several forums. Ordinarily, these plaintiffs
will select that forum whose choice-of-law rules are
most advantageous. Thus, if the possibility of an
unfavorable change in substantive law is given
substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry,
dismissal would rarely be proper.
Except for the court below, every Federal Court of
Appeals that has considered this question after Gilbert
has held that dismissal on grounds of forum non
conveniens may be granted even though the law
applicable in the alternative forum is less favorable to
the plaintiff's chance of recovery. See, e. g., Pain v.
United Technologies Corp., 205 U. S. App. D. C. 229,
248-249, 637 F.2d 775, 794-795 (1980); Fitzgerald v.
Texaco, Inc., 521 F.2d 448, 453 (CA2 1975), cert. denied,
423 U.S. 1052 (1976); Anastasiadis v. S.S. Little John,
346 F.2d 281, 283 (CA5 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 920
(1966).16 Several Courts have relied expressly on Canada
Malting to hold that the possibility of an unfavorable
change of law should not, by itself, bar dismissal. See
Fitzgerald [454 U.S. 251] v. Texaco, Inc., supra; AngloAmerican
Grain Co. v. The S/T Mina D'Amico, 169
F.Supp. 908 (ED Va. 1959).
The Court of Appeals' approach is not only inconsistent
with the purpose of the forum non conveniens doctrine,
but also poses substantial practical problems. If the
possibility of a change in law were given substantial
weight, deciding motions to dismiss on the ground of
forum non conveniens would become quite difficult.
Choice-of-law analysis would become extremely
important, and the courts would frequently be required
to interpret the law of foreign jurisdictions. First, the
trial court would have to determine what law would
apply if the case were tried in the chosen forum, and
what law would apply if the case were tried in the
alternative forum. It would then have to compare the
rights, remedies, and procedures available under the law
that would be applied in each forum. Dismissal would be
appropriate only if the court concluded that the law
applied by the alternative forum is as favorable to the
plaintiff as that of the chosen forum. The doctrine of
forum non conveniens, however, is designed in part to
help courts avoid conducting complex exercises in
comparative law. As we stated in Gilbert, the public
interest factors point towards dismissal where the court
would be required to "untangle problems in conflict of
laws, and in law foreign to itself." 330 U. S., at 509.
Upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals would
result in other practical problems. At least where the
foreign plaintiff named an American manufacturer as
defendant,17 a court could not dismiss the case on
grounds of forum non [454 U.S. 252] conveniens where
dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in law.
The American courts, which are already extremely
attractive to foreign plaintiffs,18 would become even
more attractive. The flow of litigation into the United
States would increase and further congest already
crowded courts.19
[454 U.S. 253] The Court of Appeals based its decision,
at least in part, on an analogy between dismissals on
grounds of forum non conveniens and transfers
between federal courts pursuant to § 1404(a). In Van
Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612 (1964), this Court ruled
that a § 1404(a) transfer should not result in a change in
the applicable law. Relying on dictum in an earlier Third
Circuit opinion interpreting Van Dusen, the court
below held that that principle is also applicable to a
dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds. 630 F. 2d,
at 164, and n. 51 (citing DeMateos v. Texaco, Inc., 562
F. 2d, at 899). However, § 1404(a) transfers are different
than dismissals on the ground of forum non conveniens.
Congress enacted § 1404(a) to permit change of venue
between federal courts. Although the statute was drafted
in accordance with the doctrine of forum non
conveniens, see Revisor's Note, H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th
Cong., 1st Sess., A132 (1947); H. R. Rep. No. 2646, 79th
Cong., 2d Sess., A127 (1946), it was intended to be a
revision rather than a codification of the common law.
Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U.S. 29 (1955). District
courts were given more discretion to transfer under §
1404(a) than they had to dismiss on grounds of forum
non conveniens. Id., at 31-32.
The reasoning employed in Van Dusen v. Barrack is
simply inapplicable to dismissals on grounds of forum
non conveniens. That case did not discuss the commonlaw
doctrine. Rather, it focused on "the construction and
application" of § 1404(a). 376 U. S., at 613.20
Emphasizing the remedial [454 U.S. 254] purpose of the
statute, Barrack concluded that Congress could not have
intended a transfer to be accompanied by a change in
law. Id., at 622. The statute was designed as a "federal
housekeeping measure," allowing easy change of venue
within a unified federal system. Id., at 613. The Court
feared that if a change in venue were accompanied by a
change in law, forum-shopping parties would take
unfair advantage of the relaxed standards for transfer.
The rule was necessary to ensure the just and efficient
operation of the statute.21
We do not hold that the possibility of an unfavorable
change in law should never be a relevant consideration
in a forum non conveniens inquiry. Of course, if the
remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly
inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all,
the unfavorable change in law may be given substantial
weight; the district court may conclude that dismissal
would not be in the interests of justice.22 In these cases,
however, the remedies that [454 U.S. 255] would be
provided by the Scottish courts do not fall within this
category. Although the relatives of the decedents may
not be able to rely on a strict liability theory, and
although their potential damages award may be smaller,
there is no danger that they will be deprived of any
remedy or treated unfairly.
III
The Court of Appeals also erred in rejecting the District
Court's Gilbert analysis. The Court of Appeals stated
that more weight should have been given to the
plaintiff's choice of forum, and criticized the District
Court's analysis of the private and public interests.
However, the District Court's decision regarding the
deference due plaintiff's choice of forum was
appropriate. Furthermore, we do not believe that the
District Court abused its discretion in weighing the
private and public interests.
A
The District Court acknowledged that there is ordinarily
a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of
forum, which may be overcome only when the private
and public interest factors clearly point towards trial in
the alternative forum. It held, however, that the
presumption applies with less force when the plaintiff or
real parties in interest are foreign.
The District Court's distinction between resident or
citizen plaintiffs and foreign plaintiffs is fully justified. In
Koster, the Court indicated that a plaintiff's choice of
forum is entitled to greater deference when the plaintiff
has chosen the home forum. 330 U. S., at 524.23 When
the home forum has [454 U.S. 256] been chosen, it is
reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient.
When the plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption
is much less reasonable. Because the central purpose of
any forum non conveniens inquiry is to ensure that the
trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiff's choice deserves
less deference.24
[454 U.S. 257] B
The forum non conveniens determination is committed
to the sound discretion of the trial court. It may be
reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of
discretion; where the court has considered all relevant
public and private interest factors, and where its
balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision
deserves substantial deference. Gilbert, 330 U. S., at 511-
512; Koster, 330 U. S., at 531. Here, the Court of
Appeals expressly acknowledged that the standard of
review was one of abuse of discretion. In examining the
District Court's analysis of the public and private
interests, however, the Court of Appeals seems to have
lost sight of this rule, and substituted its own judgment
for that of the District Court.
(1)
In analyzing the private interest factors, the District
Court stated that the connections with Scotland are
"overwhelming." 479 F. Supp., at 732. This
characterization may be somewhat exaggerated.
Particularly with respect to the question of relative ease
of access to sources of proof, the private interests point
in both directions. As respondent emphasizes, records
concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the
propeller and plane are located in the United States. She
would have greater access to sources of proof relevant to
her strict liability and negligence theories if trial were
held here.25 However, the District Court did not act [454
U.S. 258] unreasonably in concluding that fewer
evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were
held in Scotland. A large proportion of the relevant
evidence is located in Great Britain.
The Court of Appeals found that the problems of proof
could not be given any weight because Piper and
Hartzell failed to describe with specificity the evidence
they would not be able to obtain if trial were held in the
United States. It suggested that defendants seeking
forum non conveniens dismissal must submit affidavits
identifying the witnesses they would call and the
testimony these witnesses would provide if the trial
were held in the alternative forum. Such detail is not
necessary.26 Piper and Hartzell have moved for dismissal
precisely because many crucial witnesses are located
beyond the reach of compulsory process, and thus are
difficult to identify or interview. Requiring extensive
investigation would defeat the purpose of their motion.
Of course, defendants must provide enough information
to enable the District Court to balance the parties'
interests. Our examination of the record convinces us
that sufficient information [454 U.S. 259] was provided
here. Both Piper and Hartzell submitted affidavits
describing the evidentiary problems they would face if
the trial were held in the United States.27
The District Court correctly concluded that the
problems posed by the inability to implead potential
third-party defendants clearly supported holding the
trial in Scotland. Joinder of the pilot's estate, Air
Navigation, and McDonald is crucial to the presentation
of petitioners' defense. If Piper and Hartzell can show
that the accident was caused not by a design defect, but
rather by the negligence of the pilot, the plane's owners,
or the charter company, they will be relieved of all
liability. It is true, of course, that if Hartzell and Piper
were found liable after a trial in the United States, they
could institute an action for indemnity or contribution
against these parties in Scotland. It would be far more
convenient, however, to resolve all claims in one trial.
The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. Forcing
petitioners to rely on actions for indemnity or
contributions would be "burdensome" but not "unfair."
630 F. 2d, at 162. Finding that trial in the plaintiff's
chosen forum would be burdensome, however, is
sufficient to support dismissal on grounds of forum non
conveniens.28
(2)
The District Court's review of the factors relating to the
public interest was also reasonable. On the basis of its
[454 U.S. 260] choice-of-law analysis, it concluded that if
the case were tried in the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper
and Scottish law to Hartzell. It stated that a trial
involving two sets of laws would be confusing to the
jury. It also noted its own lack of familiarity with
Scottish law. Consideration of these problems was
clearly appropriate under Gilbert; in that case we
explicitly held that the need to apply foreign law pointed
towards dismissal.29 The Court of Appeals found that
the District Court's choice-of-law analysis was incorrect,
and that American law would apply to both Hartzell and
Piper. Thus, lack of familiarity with foreign law would
not be a problem. Even if the Court of Appeals'
conclusion is correct, however, all other public interest
factors favored trial in Scotland.
Scotland has a very strong interest in this litigation. The
accident occurred in its airspace. All of the decedents
were Scottish. Apart from Piper and Hartzell, all
potential plaintiffs and defendants are either Scottish or
English. As we stated in Gilbert, there is "a local interest
in having localized controversies decided at home." 330
U. S., at 509. Respondent argues that American citizens
have an interest in ensuring that American
manufacturers are deterred from producing defective
products, and that additional deterrence might be
obtained if Piper and Hartzell were tried in the United
States, where they could be sued on the basis of both
negligence and strict liability. However, the incremental
deterrence that would be gained if this trial were held in
an [454 U.S. 261] American court is likely to be
insignificant. The American interest in this accident is
simply not sufficient to justify the enormous
commitment of judicial time and resources that would
inevitably be required if the case were to be tried here.
IV
The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the
possibility of an unfavorable change in law bars
dismissal on the ground of forum non conveniens. It
also erred in rejecting the District Court's Gilbert
analysis. The District Court properly decided that the
presumption in favor of the respondent's forum choice
applied with less than maximum force because the real
parties in interest are foreign. It did not act
unreasonably in deciding that the private interests
pointed towards trial in Scotland. Nor did it act
unreasonably in deciding that the public interests
favored trial in Scotland. Thus, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
