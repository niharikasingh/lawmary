These cases present the question whether Congress, by
enacting 28 U. S. C. § 1367, overruled this Court's
decisions in Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583, 589
(1939) (reaffirming the holding of Troy Bank v. G. A.
Whitehead & Co., 222 U. S. 39, 40 (1911)), and Zahn v.
International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973). Clark held
that, when federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on a
specified amount in controversy, each plaintiff joined in
the litigation must independently meet the jurisdictional
amount requirement. Zahn confirmed that in class
actions governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
23(b)(3), "[e]ach [class member] . . . must satisfy the
jurisdictional amount, and any [class member] who does
not must be dismissed from the case." 414 U. S., at 301.
Section 1367, all agree, was designed to overturn this
Court's decision in Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545
(1989). Finley concerned not diversity-of-citizenship
jurisdiction (28 U. S. C. § 1332), but original federalcourt
jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law (28
U. S. C. § 1331). [545 U.S. 578] The plaintiff in Finley
sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims
Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. § 1346(b), to recover for the
death of her husband and children in an airplane crash.
She alleged that the Federal Aviation Administration's
negligence contributed to the fatal accident. She later
amended her complaint to add state-law tort claims
against two other defendants, a municipality and a
utility company. 490 U. S., at 546-547. No independent
basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed over
the state-law claims. The plaintiff could not have
brought her entire action in state court, because federal
jurisdiction in FTCA actions is exclusive. § 1346(b).
Hence, absent federal jurisdiction embracing the statelaw
claims, she would be obliged to pursue two discrete
actions, one in federal court, the other in state court.
This Court held, nevertheless, that the District Court
lacked jurisdiction over the "pendent-party" state-law
claims. Id., at 555-556. In so holding, the Court stressed
that Congress held the control rein. Id., at 547-549.
Congress could reverse the result in Finley, and permit
pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims against
additional defendants, if it so chose. Id., at 556. Congress
did so in § 1367.
What more § 1367 wrought is an issue on which courts
of appeals have sharply divided. Compare Stromberg
Metal Works, Inc. v. Press Mechanical, Inc., 77 F. 3d
928, 930 (CA7 1996) (§ 1367 "supersedes Clark and
allows pendent-party jurisdiction when the additional
parties have claims worth less than [the jurisdictional
minimum]"), and In re Abbott Labs., 51 F. 3d 524, 529
(CA5 1995) ("[U]nder § 1367 a district court can
exercise supplemental jurisdiction over members of a
class, although they did not meet the amount-incontroversy
requirement, as did the class
representatives."), with Meritcare Inc. v. St. Paul
Mercury Ins. Co., 166 F. 3d 214, 222 (CA3 1999) (§
1367 "preserves the prohibition against aggregation
outlined in [Zahn and Clark]"), and Leonhardt v.
Western Sugar Co., 160 F. 3d 631, 641 (CA10 1998) (§
1367 does not alter "the historical rules prohibiting
aggregation [545 U.S. 579] of claims, including Zahn's
prohibition of such aggregation in diversity class
actions"). The Court today holds that § 1367, although
prompted by Finley, a case in which original access to
federal court was predicated on a federal question,
notably enlarges federal diversity jurisdiction. The
Court reads § 1367 to overrule Clark and Zahn, thereby
allowing access to federal court by coplaintiffs or class
members who do not meet the now in excess of $75,000
amount-in-controversy requirement, so long as at least
one coplaintiff, or the named class representative, has a
jurisdictionally sufficient claim. Ante, at 549.
The Court adopts a plausibly broad reading of § 1367, a
measure that is hardly a model of the careful drafter's
art. There is another plausible reading, however, one
less disruptive of our jurisprudence regarding
supplemental jurisdiction. If one reads § 1367(a) to
instruct, as the statute's text suggests, that the district
court must first have "original jurisdiction" over a "civil
action" before supplemental jurisdiction can attach, then
Clark and Zahn are preserved, and supplemental
jurisdiction does not open the way for joinder of
plaintiffs, or inclusion of class members, who do not
independently meet the amount-in-controversy
requirement. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that
this narrower construction is the better reading of §
1367.
I
A
Section 1367, captioned "Supplemental jurisdiction,"
codifies court-recognized doctrines formerly labeled
"pendent" and "ancillary" jurisdiction. Pendent
jurisdiction involved the enlargement of federalquestion
litigation to include related state-law claims.
Ancillary jurisdiction evolved primarily to protect
defending parties, or others whose rights might be
adversely affected if they could not air their claims in an
ongoing federal-court action. Given jurisdiction over
the principal action, federal courts entertained certain
matters [545 U.S. 580] deemed ancillary regardless of the
citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.
Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715 (1966), the
leading pendent jurisdiction case, involved a claim
against a union for wrongfully inducing the plaintiff's
discharge. The plaintiff stated a federal claim under the
Taft-Hartley Act, and an allied state-law claim of
unlawful conspiracy to interfere with his employment
contract. This Court upheld the joinder of federal and
state claims. "[T]here is power in federal courts to hear
the whole," the Court said, when the state and federal
claims "derive from a common nucleus of operative fact"
and are so linked that the plaintiff "would ordinarily be
expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding." Id.,
at 725.
Gibbs involved the linkage of federal and state claims
against the same defendant. In Finley v. United States,
490 U. S. 545, the Court contained Gibbs. Without
congressional authorization, the Court admonished, the
pendent jurisdiction umbrella could not be stretched to
cover the joinder of additional parties. Gibbs had
departed from earlier decisions recognizing that
"jurisdiction [must] be explicitly conferred," the Court
said. 490 U. S., at 556. Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1
(1976), the Court observed, although resting "on a much
narrower basis," R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,
Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal
System 925 (5th ed. 2003) (hereinafter Hart &
Wechsler), had already signaled that "the Gibbs
approach would not be extended to the pendent-party
field," Finley, 490 U. S., at 556. While the Finley Court
did not "limit or impair" Gibbs itself, 490 U. S., at 556,
for further development of pendent jurisdiction, the
Court made it plain, the initiative would lie in Congress'
domain, id., at 555-556.[1]
[545 U.S. 581] Ancillary jurisdiction, which evolved as a
more sprawling doctrine than pendent jurisdiction, was
originally rooted in "the notion that [when] federal
jurisdiction in [a] principal suit effectively controls the
property or fund under dispute, other claimants thereto
should be allowed to intervene in order to protect their
interests, without regard to jurisdiction." Aldinger, 427
U. S., at 11; see, e. g., Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450
(1861). In Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger,
437 U. S. 365 (1978), the Court addressed the
permissible scope of the doctrine in relation to the
liberal provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure for joinder of parties and claims.
Kroger commenced as a suit between a citizen of Iowa
and a Nebraska corporation. When the Nebraska
defendant impleaded an Iowa corporation as a thirdparty
defendant under Rule 14(a), the plaintiff asserted
state-law claims against the impleaded party. No
independent basis of federal jurisdiction existed over the
newly asserted claims, for both plaintiff and impleaded
defendant were citizens of Iowa. 437 U. S., at 370. The
Court held that the plaintiff could not draw in a cocitizen
defendant in this manner. Id., at 377. Federal
courts, by the time of Kroger, were routinely exercising
ancillary jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims,
impleader claims, cross-claims among defendants, and
claims of parties who intervened "of right." See id., at
375, n. 18 (collecting cases). In Kroger, however,
"the nonfederal claim . . . was asserted by the plaintiff, who
voluntarily chose to bring suit upon a state-law claim in a federal
court. By contrast, ancillary jurisdiction typically involve[d] claims
by a defending party haled into court against his will, or by another
person whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless he could [545
U.S. 582] assert them in an ongoing action in a federal court." Id., at
376.
Having "chosen the federal rather than the state forum,"
the Court said, the plaintiff had to "accept its
limitations." Ibid.
In sum, in federal-question cases before § 1367's
enactment, the Court recognized pendent-claim
jurisdiction, Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725, but not pendentparty
jurisdiction, Finley, 490 U. S., at 555-556. As to
ancillary jurisdiction, the Court adhered to the
limitation that in diversity cases, throughout the
litigation, all plaintiffs must remain diverse from all
defendants. See Kroger, 437 U. S., at 374.
Although pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction
evolved discretely,[2] the Court has recognized that they
are "two species of the same generic problem: Under
what circumstances may a federal court hear and decide
a state-law claim arising between citizens of the same
State?" Id., at 370. Finley regarded that question as one
properly addressed to Congress. See 490 U. S., at 549,
556; 13 Wright & Miller § 3523, p. 127 (2d ed., Supp.
2005); Hart & Wechsler 924-926.
B
Shortly before the Court decided Finley, Congress had
established the Federal Courts Study Committee to take
up issues relating to "the federal courts' congestion,
delay, expense, and expansion." Judicial Conference of
the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study
Committee 3 (Apr. 2, 1990) (hereinafter Committee
Report). The Committee's charge was to conduct a
study addressing the "crisis" in federal courts caused by
the "rapidly growing" caseload. Id., at 6 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
[545 U.S. 583] Among recommendations, the
Committee urged Congress to "authorize federal courts
to assert pendent jurisdiction over parties without an
independent federal jurisdictional base." Id., at 47. If
adopted, this recommendation would overrule Finley.
Earlier, a Subcommittee had recommended that
Congress overrule both Finley and Zahn. Report of the
Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and
Their Relationship to the States 547, 561, n. 33 (Mar.
12, 1990), reprinted in 1 Judicial Conference of the
United States, Federal Courts Study Committee,
Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1,
1990) (hereinafter Subcommittee Report). In the
Subcommittee's view, "[f]rom a policy standpoint,"
Zahn "ma[de] little sense." Subcommittee Report, at
561, n. 33.[3] The full Committee, however, urged only
the overruling of Finley and did not adopt the
recommendation to overrule Zahn. Committee Report,
at 47-48.
As a separate matter, a substantial majority of the
Committee "strongly recommend[ed]" the elimination
of diversity jurisdiction, save for "complex multi-state
litigation, interpleader, and suits involving aliens." Id., at
38-39; accord Subcommittee Report, at 454-458. "[N]o
other step," the Committee's Report maintained, "will
do anywhere nearly as much to reduce federal caseload
pressures and contain the growth of the federal
judiciary." Committee Report, at 39.
Congress responded by adopting, as part of the Judicial
Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089,[4]
recommendations [545 U.S. 584] of the Federal Courts
Study Committee ranked by the House Committee on
the Judiciary as "modest" and "noncontroversial." H. R.
Rep. No. 101-734, pp. 15-16 (1990) (hereinafter H. R.
Rep.); see also 136 Cong. Rec. 36288 (1990). Congress
did not take up the Study Committee's immodest
proposal to curtail diversity jurisdiction. It did, however,
enact a supplemental jurisdiction statute, codified as 28
U. S. C. § 1367.
II
A
Section 1367, by its terms, operates only in civil actions
"of which the district courts have original jurisdiction."
The "original jurisdiction" relevant here is diversity-ofcitizenship
jurisdiction, conferred by § 1332. The
character of that jurisdiction is the essential backdrop
for comprehension of § 1367.
The Constitution broadly provides for federal-court
jurisdiction in controversies "between Citizens of
different States." Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. This Court has read
that provision to demand no more than "minimal
diversity," i. e., so long as one party on the plaintiffs' side
and one party on the defendants' side are of diverse
citizenship, Congress may authorize federal courts to
exercise diversity jurisdiction. See State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967).
Further, the Constitution includes no amount-incontroversy
limitation on the exercise of federal
jurisdiction. But from the start, Congress, as its
measures have been construed by this Court, has limited
federal-court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in two
principal ways. First, unless Congress specifies
otherwise, diversity must be "complete," i. e., all parties
on plaintiffs' side must be diverse from all parties on
defendants' side. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267
(1806); see 13B Wright & Miller § 3605 (2d ed. [545 U.S.
585] 1984). Second, each plaintiff's stake must
independently meet the amount-in-controversy
specification: "When two or more plaintiffs, having
separate and distinct demands, unite for convenience
and economy in a single suit, it is essential that the
demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional
amount." Troy Bank, 222 U. S., at 40.
The statute today governing federal-court exercise of
diversity jurisdiction in the generality of cases, § 1332,
like all its predecessors, incorporates both a diversecitizenship
requirement and an amount-in-controversy
specification.[5] As to the latter, the statute reads: "The
district courts shall have original jurisdiction [in
diversity-of-citizenship cases] where the matter in
controversy exceeds the sum . . . of $75,000." § 1332(a).
This Court has long held that, in determining whether
the amount-in-controversy requirement has been
satisfied, a single plaintiff may aggregate two or more
claims against a single defendant, even if the claims are
unrelated. See, e. g., Edwards v. Bates County, 163 U. S.
269, 273 (1896). But in multiparty cases, including class
actions, we have unyieldingly adhered to the
nonaggregation [545 U.S. 586] rule stated in Troy Bank.
See Clark, 306 U. S., at 589 (reaffirming the "familiar
rule that when several plaintiffs assert separate and
distinct demands in a single suit, the amount involved in
each separate controversy must be of the requisite
amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district
court, and that those amounts cannot be added together
to satisfy jurisdictional requirements"); Snyder v. Harris,
394 U. S. 332, 339-340 (1969) (abandonment of the
nonaggregation rule in class actions would undercut the
congressional "purpose . . . to check, to some degree, the
rising caseload of the federal courts").
This Court most recently addressed "[t]he meaning of [§
1332's] `matter in controversy' language" in Zahn, 414
U. S., at 298. Zahn, like Snyder decided four years
earlier, was a class action. In Snyder, no class member
had a claim large enough to satisfy the jurisdictional
amount. But in Zahn, the named plaintiffs had such
claims. 414 U. S., at 292. Nevertheless, the Court
declined to depart from its "longstanding construction
of the `matter in controversy' requirement of § 1332."
Id., at 301. The Zahn Court stated:
"Snyder invoked the well-established rule that each of several
plaintiffs asserting separate and distinct claims must satisfy the
jurisdictional-amount requirement if his claim is to survive a
motion to dismiss. This rule plainly mandates not only that there
may be no aggregation and that the entire case must be dismissed
where none of the plaintiffs claims [meets the amount-in-
controversy requirement] but also requires that any plaintiff
without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case,
even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims." Id., at
300.
The rule that each plaintiff must independently satisfy
the amount-in-controversy requirement, unless
Congress expressly orders otherwise, was thus the
solidly established [545 U.S. 587] reading of § 1332 when
Congress enacted the Judicial Improvements Act of
1990, which added § 1367 to Title 28.
B
These cases present the question whether Congress
abrogated the nonaggregation rule long tied to § 1332
when it enacted § 1367. In answering that question,
"context [should provide] a crucial guide." Rosario
Ortega v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 370 F. 3d 124, 135 (CA1
2004). The Court should assume, as it ordinarily does,
that Congress legislated against a background of law
already in place and the historical development of that
law. See National Archives and Records Admin. v.
Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004). Here, that background
is the statutory grant of diversity jurisdiction, the
amount-in-controversy condition that Congress, from
the start, has tied to the grant, and the nonaggregation
rule this Court has long applied to the determination of
the "matter in controversy."
Section 1367(a) provides:
"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly
provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which
the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall
have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so
related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that
they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of
the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall
include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional
parties."
The Court is unanimous in reading § 1367(a) to permit
pendent-party jurisdiction in federal-question cases, and
thus, to overrule Finley. The basic jurisdictional grant, §
1331, provides that "[t]he district courts shall have
original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the
Constitution, [545 U.S. 588] laws, or treaties of the
United States." Since 1980, § 1331 has contained no
amount-in-controversy requirement. See 94 Stat. 2369
(eliminating § 1331's amount-in-controversy
requirement). Once there is a civil action presenting a
qualifying claim arising under federal law, § 1331's sole
requirement is met. District courts, we have held, may
then adjudicate, additionally, state-law claims
"deriv[ing] from a common nucleus of operative fact."
Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725. Section 1367(a) enlarges that
category to include not only state-law claims against the
defendant named in the federal claim, but also "[statelaw]
claims that involve the joinder or intervention of
additional parties."[6]
The Court divides, however, on the impact of § 1367(a)
on diversity cases controlled by § 1332. Under the
majority's reading, § 1367(a) permits the joinder of
related claims cut loose from the nonaggregation rule
that has long attended actions under § 1332. Only the
claims specified in § 1367(b)[7] would be excluded from
§ 1367(a)'s expansion of § 1332's grant [545 U.S. 589] of
diversity jurisdiction. And because § 1367(b) contains
no exception for joinder of plaintiffs under Rule 20 or
class actions under Rule 23, the Court concludes, Clark
and Zahn have been overruled.[8]
The Court's reading is surely plausible, especially if one
detaches § 1367(a) from its context and attempts no
reconciliation with prior interpretations of § 1332's
amount-incontroversy requirement. But § 1367(a)'s
text, as the First Circuit held, can be read another way,
one that would involve no rejection of Clark and Zahn.
As explained by the First Circuit in Ortega, and applied
to class actions by the Tenth Circuit in Leonhardt, see
supra, at 578-579, § 1367(a) addresses "civil action[s] of
which the district courts have original jurisdiction," a
formulation that, in diversity cases, is sensibly read to
incorporate the rules on joinder and aggregation tightly
tied to § 1332 at the time of § 1367's enactment. On this
reading, a complaint must first meet that "original
jurisdiction" measurement. If it does not, no
supplemental jurisdiction is authorized. If it does, §
1367(a) authorizes "supplemental jurisdiction" over
related claims. In other words, § 1367(a) would preserve
undiminished, as part and parcel of § 1332 "original
jurisdiction" determinations, both the "complete
diversity" rule and [545 U.S. 590] the decisions
restricting aggregation to arrive at the amount in
controversy.[9] Section 1367(b)'s office, then, would be
"to prevent the erosion of the complete diversity [and
amount-in-controversy] requirement[s] that might
otherwise result from an expansive application of what
was once termed the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction."
See Pfander, Supplemental Jurisdiction and Section
1367: The Case for a Sympathetic Textualism, 148 U.
Pa. L. Rev. 109, 114 (1999); infra, at 593-594. In contrast
to the Court's construction of § 1367, which draws a
sharp line between the diversity and amount-incontroversy
components of § 1332, see ante, at 554;
supra, at 585, n. 5, the interpretation presented here
does not sever the two jurisdictional requirements.
The more restrained reading of § 1367 just outlined
would yield affirmance of the First Circuit's judgment in
Ortega, and reversal of the Eleventh Circuit's judgment
in Exxon. It would not discard entirely, as the Court
does, the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and
ancillary jurisdiction as they existed when Finley was
decided.[10] Instead, it would recognize § 1367 essentially
as a codification of those doctrines, placing them under
a single heading, but largely retaining their substance,
with overriding Finley the only basic change:
Supplemental jurisdiction, once the district court has
original jurisdiction, would now include "claims that
involve the joinder or intervention of additional
parties." § 1367(a).
Pendent jurisdiction, as earlier explained, see supra, at
579-580, applied only in federal-question cases and
allowed [545 U.S. 591] plaintiffs to attach nonfederal
claims to their jurisdiction-qualifying claims. Ancillary
jurisdiction applied primarily, although not exclusively,
in diversity cases and "typically involve[d] claims by a
defending party haled into court against his will."
Kroger, 437 U. S., at 376 (emphasis added); see also id.,
at 375, n. 18; supra, at 581-582. As the First Circuit
observed, neither doctrine permitted a plaintiff to
circumvent the dual requirements of § 1332 (diversity of
citizenship and amount in controversy) "simply by
joining her [jurisdictionally inadequate] claim in an
action brought by [a] jurisdictionally competent
diversity plaintiff." Ortega, 370 F. 3d, at 138.
Not only would the reading I find persuasive "alig[n]
statutory supplemental jurisdiction with the judicially
developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary
jurisdiction," ibid., it would also synchronize § 1367
with the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1441. As the First
Circuit carefully explained:
"Section 1441, like § 1367, applies only if the `civil action' in
question is one `of which the district courts . . . have original
jurisdiction.' § 1441(a). Relying on that language, the Supreme
Court has interpreted § 1441 to prohibit removal unless the entire
action, as it stands at the time of removal, could have been filed in
federal court in the first instance. See, e. g., Syngenta Crop
Protection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 33 (2002); Okla. Tax
Comm'n v. Graham, 489 U. S. 838, 840 (1989) (per curiam). Section
1441 has thus been held to incorporate the well-pleaded complaint
rule, see City of Chicago [v. International College of Surgeons, 522
U. S. 156, 163 (1997)];[11] the complete diversity rule, see
Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996);[545 U.S. 592] and
rules for calculating the amount in controversy, see St. Paul
Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 291-292
(1938)." 370 F. 3d, at 138 (citations omitted and footnote added).
The less disruptive view I take of § 1367 also accounts
for the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class
actions in § 1367(b)'s text. If one reads § 1367(a) as a
plenary grant of supplemental jurisdiction to federal
courts sitting in diversity, one would indeed look for
exceptions in § 1367(b). Finding none for permissive
joinder of parties or class actions, one would conclude
that Congress effectively, even if unintentionally,
overruled Clark and Zahn. But if one recognizes that the
nonaggregation rule delineated in Clark and Zahn forms
part of the determination whether "original jurisdiction"
exists in a diversity case, see supra, at 590, then plaintiffs
who do not meet the amount-in-controversy
requirement would fail at the § 1367(a) threshold.
Congress would have no reason to resort to a § 1367(b)
exception to turn such plaintiffs away from federal
court, given that their claims, from the start, would fall
outside the court's § 1332 jurisdiction. See Pfander,
supra, at 148.
Nor does the more moderate reading assign different
meanings to "original jurisdiction" in diversity and
federal-question cases. See ante, at 561. As the First
Circuit stated:
"`[O]riginal jurisdiction' in § 1367(a) has the same meaning in
every case: [An] underlying statutory grant of original jurisdiction
must be satisfied. What differs between [545 U.S. 593] federal
question and diversity cases is not the meaning of `original
jurisdiction' but rather the [discrete] requirements of sections 1331
and 1332. Under § 1331, the sole issue is whether a federal question
appears on the face of the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint; the
[citizenship] of the parties and the amounts they stand to recover
[do not bear on that determination]. Section 1332, by contrast,
predicates original jurisdiction on the identity of the parties (i. e.,
[their] complete diversity) and their [satisfaction of the amount-incontroversy
specification]. [In short,] the `original jurisdiction'
language in § 1367 operates differently in federal-question and
diversity cases not because the meaning of that term varies, but
because the [jurisdiction-granting] statutes are different." 370 F. 3d,
at 139-140.
What is the utility of § 1367(b) under my reading of §
1367(a)? Section 1367(a) allows parties other than the
plaintiff to assert reactive claims once entertained under
the heading ancillary jurisdiction. See supra, at 581
(listing claims, including compulsory counterclaims and
impleader claims, over which federal courts routinely
exercised ancillary jurisdiction). As earlier observed, see
supra, at 590-591, § 1367(b) stops plaintiffs from
circumventing § 1332's jurisdictional requirements by
using another's claim as a hook to add a claim that the
plaintiff could not have brought in the first instance.
Kroger is the paradigm case. See supra, at 581-582.
There, the Court held that ancillary jurisdiction did not
extend to a plaintiff's claim against a nondiverse party
who had been impleaded by the defendant under Rule
14. Section 1367(b), then, is corroborative of § 1367(a)'s
coverage of claims formerly called ancillary, but
provides exceptions to ensure that accommodation of
added claims would not fundamentally alter "the
jurisdictional requirements of section 1332." See
Pfander, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 135-137.
[545 U.S. 594] While § 1367's enigmatic text[12] defies
flawless interpretation, see supra, at 589, n. 8,[13] the
precedent-preservative reading, I am persuaded, better
accords with the historical and legal context of
Congress' enactment of the supplemental jurisdiction
statute, see supra, at 582-584, 587, and the established
limits on pendent and ancillary jurisdiction, see supra, at
580-582. It does not attribute to Congress a
jurisdictional enlargement broader than the one to
which the legislators adverted, cf. Finley, 490 U. S., at
549, and it follows the sound counsel that "close
questions of [statutory] construction should be resolved
in favor of continuity and [545 U.S. 595] against change,"
Shapiro, Continuity and Change in Statutory
Interpretation, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 921, 925 (1992).[14]

For the reasons stated, I would hold that § 1367 does
not overrule Clark and Zahn. I would therefore affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit and reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
