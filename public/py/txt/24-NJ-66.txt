The plaintiff suffered serious injuries in an automobile
accident and, after trial, received a jury verdict in the
sum of $3,000. He applied for a new trial because of the
inadequacy of the verdict but his application was denied
when the defendants consented that the damages
awarded to the plaintiff be increased to the sum of
$7,500. The plaintiff appealed and we thereafter
certified on our own motion.
On September 17, 1953 motorcycle officer Petras was on
traffic duty at the intersection of Bunn's Lane and
Amboy [24 N.J. 68] Avenue in the Township of
Woodbridge. He halted north-and south-bound traffic
along Amboy Avenue to enable the crossing of school
children. The plaintiff's car was the third in line
traveling south along Amboy Avenue and his car came
to a full stop as did the two cars ahead of him. He was
then struck in the rear by a truck owned by the
partnership defendant and driven by the individual
defendant. According to the testimony of both the
plaintiff and the motorcycle officer the individual
defendant explained at the scene of the accident that he
thought his foot had "slipped off the brake." At the trial
he denied having made such statement but did admit
that he ran into the rear of the plaintiff's car and that the
stoplights on the plaintiff's car were in proper working
order. His story was that after the plaintiff's car had been
brought to a standstill, it started moving again and was
then brought to a very sudden stop after having traveled
about 12 feet. When the jury returned its unanimous
verdict its foreman stated that it had found "negligence
on the part of the truck driver." During the application
for new trial the lower court expressed the opinion that
"liability was established beyond peradventure of a
doubt," and we entertain the same view.
The plaintiff testified that when his car was struck he
"was jerked back and forth" and received "a terriffic
bang" on his head; his car went forward striking the car
ahead which in turn struck the first car in line. Although
he had received a severe impact he thought he would "be
all right" and started to drive home. On the way he
"began to get pains," stopped his car, and was ultimately
driven home by a State Trooper. He called Dr.
Copleman, who treated him during the next six weeks.
Dr. Copleman testified that his examination showed
that the plaintiff was suffering from injury to his neck
and back which he diagnosed as "a whip lash injury, the
head had been snapped back by an impact." He treated
him originally with "sedatives and drugs for his pain * *
* took x-rays of his neck and back, gave him diathermy
treatments, and finally had to recommend that he wear a
brace for his neck." [24 N.J. 69] During this time the
plaintiff, though he wore the recommended brace night
and day, complained of much pain, and seeing little
improvement Dr. Copleman recommended that the
plaintiff consult Dr. Hoffman, an orthopedic physician
of New Brunswick.
On the advice of Dr. Hoffman the plaintiff entered the
Middlesex General Hospital on November 1, 1953 and
remained there for two weeks. During that time he was
placed in traction, which failed, however, to relieve his
intense pain. Dr. Hoffman suspected that the plaintiff
was suffering from a ruptured disc and he consulted Dr.
Scheuerman, a neurological surgeon of Trenton. Dr.
Scheuerman examined the plaintiff on November 17,
1953, made a diagnosis of probable ruptured disc, and
recommended that he return to the hospital for further
study. The plaintiff returned to the hospital on
November 23, 1953 and a myelogram was performed; it
confirmed that the plaintiff had a ruptured disc, and a
hemilaminectomy was performed by Dr. Scheuerman
with Dr. Hoffman assisting. The plaintiff was discharged
from the hospital on December 10, 1953; he remained at
home until February 15, 1954 and then returned to his
employment, but only on a part-time basis. On July 20,
1954 he returned to the hospital where Dr. Scheuerman
removed oil which had been inserted in the spinal canal
during the myelogram. He did not resume full-time
work until September 1954.
Dr. Scheuerman testified that he administered postoperative
treatment to the plaintiff, who has continued
to have some pain and is "not able to do all of the usual
duties that he had previously." Dr. Hoffman testified
that the operation on the plaintiff left a residual which
he described as follows:
"Well, he has had a great deal of pain in the back. At one
time he had a listing of the pelvis, in that the iliac crests
were not level. And at that time he had a thickened sole
prescribed and heel, to bring it up to normal. And he has
no reflexes on the left side, no quadriceps extensor
reflexes, or patellar reflexes; and he has atrophy of the
calf muscles, compared with the opposite side, it is a
little over a half an inch in circumference difference."
[24 N.J. 70] The plaintiff testified that he still is unable
to perform his heavier duties and experiences back and
leg pains for which he takes prescribed narcotics, is
unable to sleep without sedation, and is unable to sit at
one place for any substantial length of time. Both Dr.
Scheuerman and Dr. Hoffman testified that there was a
causal relation between the plaintiff's accident on
September 17, 1953 and the hemilaminectomy which
was performed thereafter. No medical testimony
whatever to the contrary was introduced by the
defendants, although they do urge that the plaintiff's
injuries were attributable, at least in part, to an earlier
accident which he suffered on February 3, 1950.
The 1950 accident resulted in a law action by the
plaintiff which was later discontinued. In answers to
interrogatories in that action the plaintiff stated that he
was "partially prevented from attending his work
between February 20th and February 27th, 1950"; that
his injuries were "concussion; lumbo-sacral back sprain;
vertigo; headaches; tinnitus or ringing of both ears and
slight loss of hearing in both ears"; that he "will claim
permanent injury to his back and loss of hearing and
headaches"; and that his last medical treatments were in
May and June 1950. However, the record indicates that
the plaintiff actually suffered no really pertinent
aftermaths of the 1950 accident. He testified (and there
is nothing before us to suggest otherwise) that after
February 27, 1950 and prior to his accident of
September 17, 1953 he never lost a day's work "outside
of having a cold or something like that," and that during
that period his health was good and he engaged in sports
and heavy work in normal fashion. The defendants
suggest that prior to the 1953 accident the plaintiff had a
"chronic back condition," which they relate to the later
operation for a ruptured disc, and they refer specifically
to a hospital record entry by Dr. Hoffman; but Dr.
Hoffman made the entry on November 1, 1953 and
explained that he was referring to the plaintiff's
condition after the 1953 accident; in his own language:
"I didn't say he had a chronic back prior to the accident.
That was only after the accident."
[24 N.J. 71] The plaintiff's actual expenditures to doctors
and nurses and for drugs and hospitalization exceeded
$2,200. And although he received most of his normal
earnings despite his temporary incapacity, there was a
loss of wages approximating $620. While the jury's
verdict of $3,000 just about took care of the plaintiff's
actual monetary losses, it awarded substantially nothing
for his suffering and permanent injuries. Its gross
inadequacy was recognized by the trial judge who
pointed out that "there was no dispute but that the
plaintiff suffered excruciating pain, and was rendered
totally helpless for a considerable period of time." On
June 28, 1956 the trial judge wrote to the parties
advising that unless the defendants filed a consent in
writing that the verdict be increased from $3,000 to
$7,500, "then the verdict heretofore rendered will be set
aside and a new trial granted limited to damages only."
The consent was filed by the defendants and on June 30,
1956 a formal order was entered dismissing the
plaintiff's motion for a new trial. Though it was
unnecessary, the plaintiff obtained leave to appeal from
the Appellate Division. See R.R. 2:2-1; R.R. 4:61; cf.
State v. Richter, 21 N.J. 421 (1956), certiorari denied 351
U.S. 975, 76 S.Ct. 1039, 100 L.Ed. 1492 (1956); State v.
Haines, 20 N.J. 438 (1956); Palm Beach Mercantile Co.
v. Ivers, 2 N.J.Super. 5 (App. Div. 1949); 6 Moore's
Federal Practice 3891 (2d ed. 1953).
The first point which he urges in support of his appeal is
that once the trial court had concluded that the damages
awarded by the verdict were inadquate it had no legal
power whatever to condition the grant of a new trial
upon the defendants' failure to consent to a prescribed
increase in the verdict. But see Gaffney v. Illingsworth,
90 N.J.L. 490, 492 (E. & A. 1917); Esposito v. Lazar, 2
N.J. 257, 259 (1949); Elvin v. Public Service Coordinated
Transport, 4 N.J.Super. 491, 494 (App. Div. 1949); 1
Bradner, New Jersey Law Practice § 389 (McC. Marsh
1940); Harris, Pleading and Practice in New Jersey § 664
(rev. ed. 1939); Sheen, New Jersey Law Practice 458 (2d
ed. 1931). Much has appeared in the law reviews in
support of the practices [24 N.J. 72] of remittitur and
additur as enlightened aids in securing substantial justice
between the parties without the burden-some costs,
delays and harassments of new trials. See Carlin,
"Remittiturs and Additurs," 49 W. Va. L.Q. 1 (1942);
Note, "Correction of Damage Verdicts by Remittitur
and Additur," 44 Yale L.J. 318 (1934); Note, "Additur in
California," 40 Cal. L. Rev. 276 (1952); Note, "Additur
and Remittitur," 26 Va. L. Rev. 836 (1940). Cf. Millar,
"Notabilia of American Civil Procedure," 50 Harv. L.
Rev. 1017, 1052 (1937); Scott, Fundamentals of
Procedure in Actions at Law 119-131 (1922). The term
remittitur is used to describe an order denying the
defendant's application for new trial on condition that
the plaintiff consent to a specified reduction in the jury's
award, whereas the term additur is used to describe an
order denying the plaintiff's application for a new trial
on condition that the defendant consent to a specified
increase in the jury's award. While it is now recognized
that the two practices are logically and realistically
indistinguishable, remittiturs have been recognized
almost everywhere, whereas additurs are still outlawed
in some, though by no means all, of the states. Compare
O'Connor v. Papertsian, 309 N.Y. 465, 131 N.E.2d 883
(1956), where the New York Court of Appeals
unanimously sustained an Appellate Division order
which denied a new trial upon the defendant's consent
to increase the $1,000 awarded by the jury to the sum of
$2,500, with Dorsey v. Barba, 38 Cal.2d 350, 240 P.2d
604 (1952), where the Supreme Court of California
(with Justice Traynor dissenting) held that although its
courts could properly deny new trials upon consents by
plaintiffs to reductions, they could not properly do so
upon consents by defendants to increases. See 25
Fordham L. Rev. 150 (1956); 31 N.Y.U.L.Q. 1537
(1956); 40 Cal. L. Rev., supra; 10 Wash. & Lee L. Rev.
46 (1953).
The English precedents prior to the American
Revolution are somewhat obscure and they are
discussed in the majority and minority opinions in
Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 55 S.Ct. 296, 302, 79
L.Ed. 603 (1935). There Justice [24 N.J. 73] Sutherland,
speaking for a majority of five (with Justice Stone,
joined by Chief Justice Hughes and Justices Brandeis and
Cardozo, dissenting) held that although remittitur is
permissible in the federal courts, additur is prohibited by
the force of the provision in the Seventh Amendment
that "the right to trial by jury shall be preserved, and
that `no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined
by any court of the United States, than
according to the rules of the common law.'" In Belt v.
Lawes (1884), 12 Q.B. 356, the court sustained the
denial of a new trial upon the plaintiff's consent to
accept a lesser amount than that awarded by the jury; on
appeal, Brett, M.R. not only approved the practice
followed below but suggested that the court would also
have power "to say that the damages given are too small,
but that if the defendant will agree to their being
increased to such a sum as may be stated, a new trial
shall be refused." Cf. Armytage v. Haley (1843), 4 Q.B.
917, 114 Eng. Rep. 1143. In the later case of Watt v.
Watt (1905), A.C. 115 the court took an opposite
position and rejected the view that a court could
condition a denial of a new trial on the plaintiff's
acceptance of a reduced verdict. Lord Davey
acknowledged that a contrary practice had grown up
and that it generally served substantial justice; but he
considered that there was a lack of common law power
and referred to various judicial dicta to the effect that a
jury's award of damages could not be reduced "without
the consent of both parties." However, Justice
Sutherland in the Dimick case did not follow the result
in the Watt case and declined to upset the remittitur
practice, first approved by Justice Story in Blunt v.
Little, 3 Fed. Cas. No. 1,578 (C.C. Mass. 1822), and since
reaffirmed in many federal decisions. See Arkansas
Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, 130 U.S. 69, 9 S.Ct.
458, 32 L.Ed. 854 (1889), and the other cases cited in
Moore, supra 3739.
In his dissenting opinion in the Dimick case, Justice
Stone pointed out that the Seventh Amendment was
concerned with substance rather than form and that the
Supreme Court had often declined to construe it as
perpetuating in changeless form the minutiae of trial
practice as it existed in the English courts in 1791; he
referred to the many jury procedures unknown to the
common law but now well established in federal
practice; he considered wholly impersuasive the
suggested differentiation between the settled remittitur
practice which the majority continued and the additur
practice which it rejected; and he concluded with the
following remarks (293 U.S., at page 496, 55 S.Ct., at
page 305, 79 L.Ed., at page 616)[24 N.J. 74] :
"Appellate federal courts, although without common
law precedent, have not hesitated to resort to the
remittitur where, by its use, the necessity of a new trial
could justly be avoided. Bank of Kentucky v. Ashley, 2
Pet. 327, 329, 7 L.Ed. 440, [441]; Phillips & C. Constr.
Co. v. Seymour, 91 U.S. 646, 656, 23 L.Ed. 341, [345];
Hopkins v. Orr, 124 U.S. 510, 514, 8 S.Ct. 590, 31 L.Ed.
523, [525]; Washington & G.R. Co. v. Harmon's Adm'r
(Washington & G.R. Co. v. Tobriner), 147 U.S. 571,
590, 13 S.Ct. 557, 37 L.Ed. 284, [291]; Hansen v. Boyd,
161 U.S. 397, 411, 412, 16 S.Ct. 571, 40 L.Ed. 746, [751].
The trial judge who denies a motion for a new trial,
because the plaintiff has consented to reduce, or a
defendant has consented to increase, the amount of the
recovery, does no more than when, sitting in equity, he
withholds relief upon the compliance with a condition,
the performance of which will do substantial justice. See
Harrisonville v. W.S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289 U.S.
334, 338, 53 S.Ct. 602, 77 L.Ed. 1208, [1211].
To me it seems an indefensible anachronism for the law
to reject the like principle of decision, in reviewing on
appeal denials of motions for new trial, where the
plaintiff has consented to decrease the judgment or the
defendant has consented to increase it by the proper
amount, or to apply it in the one case and reject it in the
other. It is difficult to see upon what principle the denial
of a motion for a new trial, which for centuries has been
regarded as so much a matter of discretion that it is not
disturbed when its only support may be a bad or
inadequate reason, may nevertheless be set aside on
appeal when it is supported by a good one: That the
defendant has bound himself to pay an increased
amount of damages which the court judicially knows is
within the limits of a proper verdict."
The majority opinion in Dimick has been the subject of
much criticism and it is doubtful whether the Supreme
Court would still subscribe to it; in any event, the
Seventh [24 N.J. 75] Amendment differs somewhat
from our constitutional provision and has no
application to proceedings in our state courts. Walker v.
Sauvinet, 92 U.S. 90, 23 L.Ed. 678 (1876); Pearson v.
Yewdall, 95 U.S. 294, 24 L.Ed. 436 (1877). Cf. Maxwell
v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581, 20 S.Ct. 448, 44 L.Ed. 597 (1900);
Fay v. People of State of New York, 332 U.S. 261, 288,
67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 L.Ed. 2043, 2060 (1947). We must look
primarily to our own history and precedents in
ascertaining whether the highly desirable practices of
remittitur and additur may be adhered to in our State
without infringement of Art. I, par. 9 of the 1947
Constitution which provides as follows:
"The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate; but the
Legislature may authorize the trial of civil causes by a
jury of six persons when the matter in dispute does not
exceed fifty dollars. The Legislature may provide that in
any civil cause a verdict may be rendered by not less
than five-sixths of the jury. The Legislature may
authorize the trial of the issue of mental incompetency
without a jury."
The Constitution of 1776 had provided (Art. XXII) that
"the inestimable right of trial by jury shall remain
confirmed, as a part of the law of this colony, without
repeal, forever"; and the Constitution of 1844 had
provided (Art. I, par. 7) that "the right of trial by jury
shall remain inviolate; but the legislature may authorize
the trial of civil suits, when the matter in dispute does
not exceed fifty dollars, by a jury of six men." But our
high courts have consistently recognized that the
treasured constitutional right of trial by jury relates to
substance rather than form and does not preclude
efficient procedural devices which, though perhaps not
strictly part of the English common law, are
nevertheless wholly consistent with the fundamental
right of the parties to have the facts determined by a fair
and impartial jury acting under appropriate judicial
guidance and control. In Clayton v. Clark, 55 N.J.L. 539,
540 (Sup. Ct. 1893), the court noted that the
Constitution provides that the right to trial by jury "shall
remain inviolate, not that it [24 N.J. 76] shall be
unalterable," and later decisions have embodied the
same expression. See State v. DeLorenzo, 81 N.J.L. 613,
616 (E. & A. 1911); Sexton v. Newark Dist. Telegraph
Co., 84 N.J.L. 85, 101 (Sup. Ct. 1913), affirmed 86 N.J.L.
701 (E. & A. 1914); Robinson v. Payne, 99 N.J.L. 135,
141 (E. & A. 1923). Similarly, in Humphrey v. Eakeley,
72 N.J.L. 424, 426 (Sup. Ct. 1905), affirmed 74 N.J.L. 599
(E. & A. 1907), the court stressed that the constitutional
language imports freedom from harm or substantial
impairment but not "immunity from all regulation." See
State v. Maier, 13 N.J. 235, 276 (1953).
The remittitur practice has been recognized in New
Jersey since early days. New Jersey Flax Cotton Wool
Co. v. Mills, 26 N.J.L. 60, 63 (Sup. Ct. 1856); Rafferty v.
Bank of Jersey City, 33 N.J.L. 368, 372 (Sup. Ct. 1869);
Rafferty v. Erie R. Co., 66 N.J.L. 444, 450 (Sup. Ct.
1901); Harris, supra. Not until 1916 was it questioned,
but the Court of Errors and Appeals found little
difficulty in sustaining it. Heinz v. Delaware, L. & W.R.
Co., 90 N.J.L. 198 (E. & A. 1916). Justice Trenchard,
speaking for a unanimous court, pointed out that in
England the power had been denied in Watt v. Watt,
supra (which had in turn overruled Belt v. Lawes,
supra), but that in our State it had frequently been
invoked "to do substantial justice and save the expense
of a new trial" and that it was "in no sense an
impairment of the constitutional right of trial by jury."
During the following year, the Court of Errors and
Appeals had occasion to deal with a negligence case in
which the practice of additur had been invoked. Gaffney
v. Illingsworth, supra. The jury had returned a verdict of
$190.25 and Judge Dungan thereafter announced that if
the defendant would consent to pay the sum of $480.50
rather than the amount awarded by the jury, he would
deny the plaintiff's application for a new trial; the
defendant declined and a new trial limited to damages
was awarded. The defendant appealed, contending that
the trial court had no authority to set aside a verdict and
grant a new trial as to damages alone. Notwithstanding
the absence of any such common [24 N.J. 77] law power
(Scott, supra, 112) the Court of Errors and Appeals
summarily disposed of the defendant's contention by
reference to the provisions of the Practice Act of 1912
and the implementing court rules, which explicitly
provided for new trials limited to damages. See
Robinson v. Payne, supra. The defendant also urged that
the additur condition imposed by Judge Dungan was
beyond his power; in response, Chancellor Walker,
speaking for the entire court, had this to say (90 N.J.L.,
at page 492):
"The power of the court in granting a new trial upon
the ground that the damages are excessive, upon terms
that a new trial shall be had unless the plaintiff will
accept a certain sum named, less than that awarded by a
verdict, is too well established to be questioned. It would
seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that when a new
trial is granted because the damages are inadequate, the
court may impose like terms, that is, terms to the effect
that if the defeated party will pay a certain sum, greater
than that awarded by the verdict, the rule will be
discharged, subject, doubtless, to the power of an
appellate court to vacate any such terms when they
appear to be an abuse of discretion. No such showing is
made on the record before us, and this makes it
inappropriate for us to give consideration to the
appellant's other contention, namely, that the verdict, as
it stands, is adequate and proper and evinces no
prejudice or partiality on the part of the jury. As to
whether or not the verdict is adequate and proper is, on
application for a new trial, a matter of sound discretion
in the trial court, and, in the absence of an abuse of
discretion, the appellate court cannot review the trial
court's action. And with the question of damages, apart
from such discretion, we have nothing to do."
The Gaffney case was widely accepted as upholding
additur as well as remittitur in our State. Scott, supra,
128; Carlin, supra, 25; Harris, supra; Bradner, supra.
Thus, Dean Harris in his book on Pleading and Practice
and Professor Marsh in his revision of Bradner stated
unequivocally that the trial court had power to
condition its denial of a new trial upon the plaintiff's
consent to accept a reduced amount or upon the
defendant's consent to pay an increased amount. The
following summary in 1939 by Dean Harris may be said
to have represented the general understanding by the
bench and bar:
[24 N.J. 78] "In granting a new trial on the ground that
the verdict is excessive, the court in its discretion may
give the plaintiff the option either of accepting a
specified reduced amount of verdict, or being put to a
new trial. Similarly, when the verdict is, in the opinion
of the court, inadequate, the court may give the
defendant the option either of paying a greater sum than
awarded by the verdict or of submitting himself to a
new trial. The power to impose such terms is inherent
in the court and is regulated by the rules of the Supreme
Court. Such power may be exercised in contract actions,
as well as in tort actions involving unliquidated
damages. The exercise of the power of the court in
imposing such terms upon the parties is discretionary,
and in the absence of an abuse of discretion, not subject
to an appeal. This is one of the constitutional
prerogatives of the court, which cannot be interfered
with by legislation." Harris, supra, § 664.
The delegates to our Constitutional Convention of 1947
included many members of the legal profession who
sought to furnish our State with a modern judicial
structure which would retain benefits of the old while
acquiring advantages of the new. Though aware of the
high function of the jury system as an instrument of
justice, they knew that it had been constitutionally
subject to enlightened judicial controls and regulations
which did not impair its basic integrity. Thus they were
fully familiar with the trial court's power to withdraw a
case from the jury because of the insufficiency of the
evidence (Harris, supra, §§ 535, 538), to require that the
jury render a special verdict or answer special
interrogatories (Harris, supra, § 555), and to grant or
deny a total or partial new trial upon terms which might
include remittitur or additur (Harris, supra, § 664). At
no point during the Constitutional Convention or
thereafter was there any suggestion that these
preexisting judicial controls and regulations should in
anywise be curbed; on the contrary, the significant
movement relating to the right to trial by jury was in
itself designed to avoid "costly retrials" (1 Record of
Proceedings, Const. Conv. of 1947, p. 610) and resulted
in the express constitutional provision authorizing the
Legislature to provide for five-sixths verdicts in civil
cases. Const. 1947, Art. I, par. 9.
Shortly after the adoption of the 1947 Constitution our
courts had occasion to deal anew with the practices of
[24 N.J. 79] remittitur and additur. In Esposito v. Lazar,
supra, the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the sum
of $1,200; the trial court found the damages inadequate
and ordered a new trial limited to damages unless the
defendant consented to increasing the award to $3,500.
The defendant refused and on retrial the jury awarded
$3,000. On appeal, this court, in an opinion by Justice
Ackerson, approvingly cited Gaffney v. Illingsworth,
supra, and expressly recognized that a trial court has
discretionary power to deny a new trial upon the
plaintiff's consent to accept a reduced amount or upon
the defendant's consent to pay a larger amount. See 2
N.J., at page 259. It held, however, that in the case
before it the new trial should not have been limited to
damages because the original jury verdict appeared to
represent a compromise finding on the issue of liability.
See Hendrikson v. Koppers Co., Inc., 11 N.J. 600, 608
(1953); Juliano v. Abeles, 114 N.J.L. 510 (Sup. Ct. 1935).
Cf. Dahle v. Goodheer, 38 N.J.Super. 210 (App. Div.
1955), certiorari denied 20 N.J. 534 (1956).
In Elvin v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, supra,
the Appellate Division summarized the pertinent
judicial controls which had been exercised in our old
practice and have been continued in our new; in the
course of his opinion for the court, Judge McGeehan
said:
"In New Jersey, the judge in the trial of a negligence
action has certain recognized controls over the jury
verdict when he deems it inadequate. Under Rule 3:59-1
the judge may grant a new trial as to all or part of the
issues, upon motion made to him. Under Rule 3:59-4
the judge, of his own initiative, may order a new trial for
any reason for which he might have granted a new trial
upon motion of a party. Further, the judge, in his
discretion, may give the defendant the option of paying
a stated increase in the amount of the verdict or of going
on to a new trial as to the amount of damages, subject to
the power of an appellate court to vacate any such terms
when they appear to be an abuse of discretion. Esposito
v. Lazar, 2 N.J. 257 (1949), which is a control not
permitted in the Federal courts; Dimick v. Schiedt, 293
U.S. 474, 79 L.Ed. 603 [1935], or in the English courts
(Watt v. Watt (1905), A.C. 115, 6 B.R.C. 1)."
[24 N.J. 80] In the light of all of the foregoing, we are
satisfied that the practices of remittitur and additur
violate none of our constitutional interdictions and, if
fairly invoked, serve the laudable purpose of avoiding a
further trial where substantial justice may be attained on
the basis of the original trial. See Meszaros v.
Gransamer, 23 N.J. 179 (1957). Accordingly, we reject
the first point urged by the plaintiff and come now to
his meritorious contention that, in any event, the
prescribed increase to $7,500 was "grossly inadequate
and should be set aside." Notwithstanding earlier doubts
(Nelson v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 128 N.J.L. 46, 55 (E. &
A. 1941)) there is now no question as to the power of
our appellate courts to reverse a trial court's refusal to
grant a new trial (whether or not conditioned on
remittitur or additur) where it is satisfied that there has
been "an abuse of discretion" (Esposito v. Lazar, supra;
Elvin v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, supra)
or, in the more modern terminology, "`a manifest denial
of justice.'" See Lindroth v. Christ Hospital, 21 N.J. 588,
596 (1956); Conklin v. Miele's Motor Transportation,
Inc., 43 N.J.Super. 420, 428 (App. Div. 1957). In the
instant matter, we believe that the trial judge had a
mistaken notion of the evidence which led to his
prescribing the scanty sum of $7,500. He stated that the
plaintiff was not entitled to a "great sum, because he
certainly did have a back condition before this accident
occurred"; but the evidence in the record points to the
view that whatever "back condition" the plaintiff had as
a result of the 1950 accident had cleared up and had no
relation to the very severe injuries resulting from the
1953 accident. Under these highly special circumstances,
we believe that the trial court's action should not be
permitted to stand and that the interests of justice will
best be served by permitting a second jury to pass on the
issue of damages. The separable issue of liability was
clearly and properly decided against the defendants;
under the evidence it could hardly have been
determined otherwise and need not be submitted for
redetermination. R.R. 4:61-1; Dahle v. Goodheer, supra.
[24 N.J. 81] Reversed, with direction for a new trial on
the issue of damages.
