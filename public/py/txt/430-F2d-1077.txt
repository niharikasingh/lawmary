This is an appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff
entered in the United States District Court for the
District of Connecticut upon a jury verdict after trial
before Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard, of the Court of
Appeals of this Circuit, sitting by designation.
The action involves two subcontracts for excavation
work between D'Agostino Excavators, Inc. (D'Agostino)
and The Heyward-Robinson Company, Inc. (Heyward)
as prime contractor on two construction jobs in
Connecticut. One of the prime contracts, for the
construction of barracks at the Naval Submarine Base in
New London, Groton, was with the federal government
(the Navy job). The other, a non-federal job, was for the
construction of a plant for Stelma, Inc. at Stamford (the
Stelma job).
D'Agostino brought this action against Heyward and its
surety, Maryland Casualty Company (Maryland) under
the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. §§ 270a and 270b, to recover
payments alleged to be due on the Navy job. Heyward
answered, denying liability on the Navy job and
counterclaiming for alleged overpayments and extra
costs of completing both the Navy job and the Stelma
job. In reply, D'Agostino denied liability on the
Heyward counterclaims and interposed a reply
counterclaim to recover from Heyward monies alleged
to be due on the Stelma job.
At the trial, the two subcontracts in suit were treated
together. D'Agostino claimed that Heyward had
breached both subcontracts by failing to make progress
payments as required and that substantial sums were
owing to it from Heyward on both jobs. Heyward
claimed that D'Agostino had breached both subcontracts
by permitting its compensation and employee liability
insurance to lapse; that, as a result, Heyward on October
19, 1965 had terminated both; and that D'Agostino was
liable for overpayments and costs of completion on
both.
The issue as to whether Heyward had breached the
subcontracts prior to October 19, 1965, when Heyward
claimed to have terminated them, was submitted to the
jury as a special question. The jury found that Heyward
had breached the subcontracts prior to that date.
After amendment of the complaint by D'Agostino to
allege a claim in quantum meruit for the work
performed on both jobs, special questions then were
[430 F.2d 1080] submitted to the jury as to the
reasonable value of the work performed by D'Agostino
on each project and the net amount owed by Heyward
to D'Agostino on both. The jury found, in answer to
these questions, that the net amount owed by Heyward
to D'Agostino on both jobs was $63,988.36. Judgment
against Heyward was rendered accordingly. Under a
formula agreed to by the parties, it was determined that
the amount due to D'Agostino on the Navy job was
$40,771.46 and judgment was entered against Maryland
in that sum.
The trial court denied motions for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial pursuant
to Rules 50(b) and 59, Fed.R.Civ.P. Heyward and
Maryland appeal from the judgment against them,
raising a variety of questions which will be dealt with
seriatim.
I.
Appellants' initial contention is that the District Court
had no jurisdiction over the counterclaims on the
Stelma job. They therefore contend that the Stelma
claims must be dismissed and that since D'Agostino's
claims on the Navy and Stelma jobs were presented to
the jury as inseparable, the judgment below must be
reversed.
Appellants urge that the Stelma counterclaims are not
compulsory counterclaims over which the federal court
acquired jurisdiction ancillary to the jurisdiction which
it had over D'Agostino's Miller Act claim stated in the
complaint. They say that these are permissive
counterclaims over which the court had no ancillary
jurisdiction and which lacked the required independent
basis of federal jurisdiction.
This jurisdictional issue is raised for the first time in this
Court. In the Court below appellants affirmatively urged
that the Stelma counterclaims were compulsory.
Nevertheless, it is well settled that lack of federal
jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal,
even by a party who originally asserted that jurisdiction
existed or by the Court sua sponte. E. g., American Fire
& Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U.S. 6, 17-18, 71 S.Ct. 534,
95 L.Ed. 702 (1951); Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake
Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 384, 4 S.Ct.
510, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884); Precise Imports Corp. v. Kelly,
378 F.2d 1014, 1015-1016 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389
U.S. 973, 88 S.Ct. 472, 19 L.Ed.2d 465 (1967); John
Birch Society v. National Broadcasting Co., 377 F.2d
194, 199 (2d Cir. 1967); Shahmoon Industries Inc. v.
Imperato, 338 F.2d 449 (3rd Cir. 1964). We turn, then,
to the jurisdictional issue.
It is apparent from the record that there is no
independent basis of federal jurisdiction over the Stelma
counterclaims. Both D'Agostino and Heyward are New
York corporations with offices in New York. There is
thus no diversity jurisdiction. Clearly there is no
jurisdiction under the Miller Act over these
counterclaims since the Stelma contract did not involve
public work for the federal government.
The question is whether the Stelma counterclaims are
compulsory or are permissive. Under the rule in this
circuit, if they are permissive there is no Federal
jurisdiction over them unless they rest on independent
jurisdictional grounds. O'Connell v. Erie Lackawanna R.
R. Co., 391 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir. 1968), vacated and
ordered dismissed as moot, 395 U.S. 210, 89 S.Ct. 1767,
23 L.Ed.2d 213 (1969); Lesnik v. Public Industrials
Corporation, 144 F.2d 968, 976 n. 10 (2d Cir. 1944);
Fraser v. Astra Steamship Corp., 18 F.R.D. 240, 241-242
(S.D.N.Y.1955); Telegraph Delivery Service v. Florists
Tel. Service, 12 F.R.D. 342 (S.D.N.Y.1952); 3 J. Moore,
Federal Practice ¶ 13.19 [1] at 53-57 (2d ed. 1969). But
see Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and
Surety Company, 426 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. May 8, 1970);

Claims in the Federal Courts, 33 F.R.D. 27, 28-34
(1963); Green, Federal Jurisdiction over Counterclaims,
48 N.W.U.L.Rev. 271, 282-285 (1953).1 On the other
hand, if they are compulsory counterclaims, they are
ancillary to the claim asserted in the complaint and no
independent basis of Federal jurisdiction is required. E.
g., United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions,
Inc., 221 F.2d 213 (2d Cir. 1955). See, e. g., Moore v.
New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 46 S.Ct. 367,
70 L.Ed. 750 (1926); C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts,
§§ 9, 79 (2d ed. 1970); 3 J. Moore, supra, ¶ 13.15 at 31-
42.
Under Rule 13(a) Fed.R.Civ.P. a counterclaim is
compulsory "if it arises out of the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing
party's claim." In United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece
Productions, supra, Chief Judge Clark said:
In practice this criterion has been broadly interpreted to require not
an absolute identity of factual backgrounds for the two claims, but
only a logical relationship between them. Lesnik v. Public
Industrials Corp., 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 968, 975, citing and quoting,
inter alia, Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 610,
46 S.Ct. 367, 371, 70 L.Ed. 750, thus: "`Transaction' is a word of
flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrences,
depending not so much upon the immediateness of their
connection as upon their logical relationship." See also Blair v.
Cleveland Twist Drill Co., 7 Cir., 197 F.2d 842, 845; Wright,
Estoppel by Rule: The Compulsory Counterclaim Under Modern
Pleading, 38 Minn.L.Rev. 423, 440-445, 39 Iowa L.Rev. 255; 3
Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 13.13 (2d ed. 1948 and 1954 Supp.).
221 F.2d at 216. See United States for Use and Benefit of
Pickard Engineering Co. v. Southern Construction
Company, 293 F.2d 493, 500 (6th Cir. 1961), rev'd in
part on other grounds, sub nom. Southern Construction
Co. v. Pickard, 371 U.S. 57, 83 S.Ct. 108, 9 L.Ed.2d 31
(1962); United States v. Eastport Steamship
Corporation, 255 F.2d 795 (2d Cir. 1958); C. Wright,
supra, at 346-349.
Thus "* * * courts should give the phrase `transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter' of the suit a broad
realistic interpretation in the interest of avoiding a
multiplicity of suits." 3 J. Moore, supra, ¶ 13.13 at 33-36
(2d ed. 1969). As the Supreme Court said in Pickard:
The requirement that counterclaims arising out of the same
transaction or occurrence as the opposing party's claim "shall" be
stated in the pleadings was designed to prevent multiplicity of
actions and to achieve resolution in a single lawsuit of all disputes
arising out of common matters. 371 U.S. at 60, 83 S.Ct. at 110.
In the case at bar the counterclaims were compulsory
within the meaning of Rule 13(a). There was such a
close and logical relationship between the claims on the
Navy and Stelma jobs that the Stelma counterclaims
arose out of the same "transaction or occurrence" as
those terms are now broadly defined. Both subcontracts
were entered into by the same parties for the same type
of work and carried on during substantially the same
period. Heyward had the right to terminate both
subcontracts in the event of a breach by D'Agostino of
either. Heyward also had the right to withhold monies
due on one to apply [430 F.2d 1082] against any damages
suffered on the other. Progress payments made by
Heyward were not allocated as between jobs and were
made on a lump sum basis for both as though for a
single account.
A single insurance policy covered both jobs. The letters
of Heyward to D'Agostino of October 8 and 19, 1965
threatening termination and terminating both jobs,
allegedly because of the cancellation by D'Agostino of
this joint insurance coverage and failure to properly
man both projects, treated both jobs together. These
letters formed the basis of one of Heyward's major
claims at the trial.
The controversy between the parties which gave rise to
this litigation was with respect to both jobs and arose
from occurrences affecting both. Indeed, it would seem
to have been impossible for Heyward to have fully
litigated the claims against it on the Navy job without
including the Stelma job, because the payments it made
to D'Agostino could not be allocated between the two
jobs.
As the appellants themselves point out in their brief, the
"Stelma and Navy claims were so interwoven at the trial
that they are now absolutely incapable of separation."
The proof as to payments and alleged defaults in
payments was made without any differentiation
between the two claims and neither of the parties was
able to offer any evidence of apportionment. Finally, the
evidence as to the breaches of contract claimed by the
respective parties related in the main to both contracts
rather than to one or the other.
The jurisdictional question so belatedly raised by the
appellants must be viewed in light of the record as a
whole. So viewed, it is plain that the Stelma
counterclaims bare a logical and immediate relationship
to the claims on the Navy job. Thus they arose out of the
"transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter"
of the suit instituted by D'Agostino on the Navy job and
are compulsory counterclaims under Rule 13 (a). The
Stelma counterclaims were thus ancillary to the claims
asserted in the complaint over which the Federal Court
had acquired jurisdiction under the Miller Act, and there
is jurisdiction over them. E. g., Southern Construction
Co., Inc. v. Pickard, supra; Moore v. New York Cotton
Exchange, supra; United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece
Productions, Inc., supra; Lesnik v. Public Industrials
Corp., supra; United States for Use and Benefit of Foster
Wheeler Corp. v. American Surety Co. of New York,
142 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1944); United States for Use and
Benefit of Central Rigging and Contracting Corp. v.
Paul Tishman Co., 32 F.R.D. 223 (E.D.N.Y.1963). To
require that the closely related Navy and Stelma claims
must be litigated separately would result in
fragmentation of litigation and multiplicity of suits
contrary to one of the major purposes of Rule 13(a). See,
e. g., Southern Construction Co. v. Pickard, supra;
Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, supra; United
States v. Eastport Steamship Corp., supra; United Artists
Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc., supra; Lesnik v.
Public Industrials Corp., supra.
II.
Appellants next contend that the trial court committed
reversible error in excluding a memorandum offered by
Heyward as an admission by D'Agostino that the
amounts due from Heyward were less than the amounts
D'Agostino was claiming at trial.
At trial Heyward claimed that the proffered
memorandum, in the handwriting of D'Agostino's
engineer, Paolella, was made during a meeting between
Paolella and Goodman, Heyward's vice president, on
December 16, 1965 and was initialed by both. The
meeting was held after D'Agostino was off both jobs.
Heyward contended that the memorandum contained
figures supplied by D'Agostino representing the actual
dollar amounts of work D'Agostino had performed on
each of the two jobs.
D'Agostino objected to the offer on the grounds (1) that
the memorandum was made as part of settlement
negotiations [430 F.2d 1083] and (2) that there was no
showing that Paolella had authority to bind D'Agostino.
Heyward then sought to lay a foundation for its
admission by testimony of Goodman as to the nature
and circumstances under which the meeting of
December 16 was held and the memorandum made, to
show that it was not the product of settlement
negotiations and that Paolella had authority to act for
D'Agostino. The trial court, however, declined to
permit such testimony and excluded the memorandum,
stating, "I am inclined to think it was a settlement
discussion."
In a letter from Heyward to its surety, Maryland, of
January 19, 1966, which was in evidence, there were
some indications that Heyward considered the
memorandum to have been made in the course of
settlement negotiations. However, the letter by no
means established this. The proffered testimony of
Goodman might well have indicated that the
memorandum was not made in connection with
settlement discussions at all but was a statement by an
authorized representative of D'Agostino as to the
amount it then considered to be due on the two jobs. It
was only after hearing Goodman's testimony that the
trial court could determine whether the memorandum
was admissible or not. Thus it appears that the trial
court should have heard the testimony of Goodman
before passing on the admissibility of the memorandum.
Nevertheless, we do not find that this error was so
"prejudicially erroneous as to require that the cause be
remanded for a new trial." Severi v. Seneca Coal and
Iron Corporation, 381 F.2d 482, 489, n. 7 (2d Cir. 1967).
On appeal, errors during the course of the trial "which
do not affect the substantial rights of the parties" are to
be disregarded, 28 U.S.C. § 2111, Rule 61, Fed. R.Civ.P.
See Severi v. Seneca Coal and Iron Corporation, supra;
Shaw v. Scoville, 369 F.2d 909, 911-912 (2d Cir. 1966);
Draddy v. Weston Trawling Co., 344 F.2d 945 (2d Cir.
1965); Barber v. Commissioner, 152 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.
1946).
In a trial of this length and complexity, the exclusion of
the memorandum without hearing Goodman's
testimony did not affect the substantial rights of the
appellants nor was it unduly harmful or prejudicial to
them. See, e. g., Vitarelle v. Long Island R. R. Co., 415
F.2d 302 (2d Cir. 1969); Shaw v. Scoville, supra; Draddy
v. Weston Trawling Co., supra. There was ample
evidence in the record to support the verdict of the jury
on the first question of breach of the subcontracts by
Heyward prior to October 19, 1965. Had Goodman's
testimony on this subject been received, there doubtless
would have been countervailing testimony from the
other side. Against this background, the disputed
memorandum would have been only a minor and
peripheral piece of additional evidence which the jury
might have weighed and considered or rejected along
with the mass of other evidence in the record on the
question of breach of the subcontracts. The
memorandum would have had little or no bearing on
the quantum meruit question. Its admission under these
circumstances would have been highly unlikely to have
changed the result. Such error as there was here was
harmless error within the purview of 28 U.S.C. § 2111
and Rule 61, Fed.R.Civ.P. and is not ground for reversal.
III.
Appellants next contend that the charge to the jury was
erroneous in seven respects. Appellants have failed to
preserve their right to review five of these seven claimed
errors and are therefore precluded from raising them on
appeal.
Rule 51, Fed.R.Civ.P. provides in pertinent part:
* * * No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give
an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to
consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter [430 F.2d 1084] to
which he objects and the grounds for his objection. * * *
The purpose of this provision "is to prevent reversals
and consequent new trials because of errors the judge
might well have corrected if the point had been brought
to his attention." Steinhauser v. Hertz Corporation, 421
F.2d 1169, 1173 (2d Cir. 1970). See also, Pauling v.
News Syndicate Company, Inc., 335 F.2d 659, 668-671
(2d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 968, 85 S.Ct. 662,
13 L.Ed.2d 561 (1965); LiMandri v. Brasileiro, 316 F.2d
3 (2d Cir. 1963); Alexander v. Kramer Bros. Freight
Lines, Inc., 273 F.2d 373, 375 (2d Cir. 1959); Troupe v.
Chicago D & G Bay Transit Co., 234 F.2d 253, 258-260
(2d Cir. 1956); Sweeney v. United Feature Syndicate,
129 F.2d 904, 905-906 (2d Cir. 1942).
The charge of the trial court was in two parts. It charged
first on the special question posed to the jury as to
whether the subcontracts had been breached by
Heyward prior to October 19, 1965. All of the claimed
errors are in this portion of the charge. At the
conclusion of its charge on this special question, and
before the jury retired, the trial court expressly gave
counsel an opportunity to "call the Court's attention to
any omissions or errors in the charge."
In response, counsel for the appellants raised only two
objections. The first related to Heyward's right to audit
D'Agostino's bills as bearing on the time within which
payments from Heyward were due. This had not been
the subject of a request to charge; nevertheless, the
Court modified the language of the charge on this
subject in response to appellants' request and so advised
the jury.
The second concerned appellants' request to charge that
Heyward did not have to pay D'Agostino until
D'Agostino informed Heyward about its outstanding
obligations to suppliers. This request had been the
subject of extensive colloquy with the Court prior to the
charge and the Court had then rejected the request.
Counsel for the appellants merely reaffirmed the
exception previously taken to the Court's ruling.2
The Court had not rejected any other of the appellants'
requests to charge but charged on the subjects covered
by these requests in its own language. Yet the appellants
did not even refer to the Court's failure to charge as
requested on these five subjects, which they now claim
to have been error, though expressly invited by the
Court to do so.3
The case at bar is unlike such cases in this circuit as
Sweeney v. United Features Syndicate Inc., 129 F.2d 904
(2d Cir. 1942); Wright v. Farm Journal, Inc., 158 F.2d
976 (2d Cir. 1947) and Keen v. Overseas Tankship
Corporation, 194 F.2d 515, 519, cert. denied, 343 U.S.
966, 72 S.Ct. 1061, 96 L.Ed. 1363 (1952) "where the
judge, having focussed on the point, charged the
opposite of what had been requested, so that objection
would have been a useless formality." Pauling v. News
Syndicate Co., supra, 335 F.2d at 66. Nor is it like
Steinhauser v. Hertz Corporation, supra, where counsel
had made his position abundantly clear and the trial
court had made it plain that further efforts on his part to
except or object would be unavailing and had warned
him not to take exceptions. 421 F.2d at 1173.
This case is similar to Pauling v. News Syndicate Co.,
supra, and Alexander v. Kramer Bros. Freight Lines,
Inc., supra, where the trial court's attention was not
adequately called to the [430 F.2d 1085] errors and
omissions urged on appeal and such contentions were
held not to have been preserved for review. See
LiMandri v. Brasileiro, supra; Keen v. Overseas
Tankship Corp., supra, 194 F.2d at 518; 5 J. Moore,
Federal Practice ¶ 51.04 (2d ed. 1969). See also,
Rosenfeld v. Curtis Publishing Co., 163 F.2d 660 (2d
Cir. 1947).
It should be noted that the charge of the Court on the
five subjects on which appellants failed to object or
except was not, as appellants contend, the opposite of
what they requested. True, the trial court did not adopt
the language of the appellants' requests. But "[a] judge is
not bound to adopt the categorical language which
counsel choose to put into his mouth." Ayers v. Watson,
137 U.S. 584, 601, 11 S.Ct. 201, 207, 34 L.Ed. 803
(1891), quoted with approval in Alexander v. Kramer
Bros. Freight Lines, Inc., 273 F.2d at 375. Moreover, the
trial court was not "required to incorporate every
proposition of law suggested in counsel's requests
provided he covers the specific principles necessary for
the jury's guidance." Puggioni v. Luckenbach S. S. Co.,
Inc., 286 F.2d 340, 344 (2d Cir. 1961). See Halecki v.
United N. Y. & N. J. Sandy Hook Pilots Assoc., 282 F.2d
137, 140 (2d Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 941, 81
S.Ct. 461, 5 L.Ed.2d 372 (1961).
The trial court charged in its own language on each of
these five subjects of: burden of proof of default;
D'Agostino's waiver of breach prior to October 19,
1965; D'Agostino's rescission of the subcontracts;
Heyward's termination of the subcontracts; and the
treatment of both subcontracts together. The charge on
each of these subjects was fair, adequate and proper and
in accordance with applicable law.
IV.
As to the two assignments of error in the charge which
appellants preserved for review, we find that no error
was committed.
As has been indicated, the first of these related to
Heyward's right to audit D'Agostino's bills as bearing on
the time within which payments from Heyward were
due. The Court charged that payments from Heyward
were due "within a short time" after D'Agostino's bills
were rendered. At the conclusion of the charge,
appellants' counsel objected and requested a
supplemental charge to the effect that Heyward was
entitled to an opportunity to audit the bills before it was
required to make payment. The court granted the
appellants' request only to the extent of giving a
supplemental instruction to the jury that "within a short
time" meant "within a reasonable time." The Court
pointed out to appellants that they had not "requested
any charge on that subject * * * [a]nd to charge it now *
* * would give it [the subject] undue emphasis."
The supplemental charge given was quite adequate
under the circumstances and the trial court was well
within its discretion in refusing to go further at that
point in the trial.
The second claimed error preserved for review concerns
the Court's refusal to charge, as requested by appellants,
that Heyward was not required to make progress
payments to D'Agostino until D'Agostino informed
Heyward about its outstanding obligations to its
suppliers. Appellants' position, in substance, was that
Heyward could use D'Agostino's failure to pay its
suppliers as an excuse for nonpayment even if at the
time payment was due it had no knowledge that
D'Agostino had failed to make such payments. On the
appellants' theory, if this were so, Heyward could have
justified any failure on its part to make progress
payments when due if it later discovered that
D'Agostino was then indebted to its suppliers, even
though this was not the reason for Heyward's failure to
make the progress payments when required.
The trial court quite properly rejected this contention.
As to Heyward's claim that it was entitled to withhold
$30,000 of progress payments due to D'Agostino to
protect itself from possible liability to D'Agostino's
suppliers, the [430 F.2d 1086] Court charged that this
amount could have been deducted from what was
otherwise due to D'Agostino:
* * * if and only if you find three things: first, that HeywardRobinson
knew of the amounts due to D'Agostino's suppliers;
secondly, that Heyward-Robinson reasonably notified D'Agostino
or that D'Agostino knew of Heyward-Robinson's intent to
withhold payment of this amount; and, thirdly, that HeywardRobinson
actually withheld payments of this amount for the
purpose of protecting itself from liability from the Plaintiff's
suppliers and not for some other reason.
It further charged that Heyward "has the burden of
proof with respect to these three matters."
The charge on this subject was a substantially correct
statement of the circumstances under which Heyward
had the right to withhold progress payments to protect
itself against liability to D'Agostino's suppliers under the
terms of the subcontracts in suit.
V.
Appellants make the contention that Heyward should
have been credited as a matter of law with the full face
amount of four promissory notes totaling $36,250
which Heyward had given to D'Agostino and which
D'Agostino had negotiated to third parties at a discount.
These notes had been reacquired by Heyward, the
maker, for the sum of $18,500, after Heyward had
dishonored them and litigation had been instituted by
the endorsees.
The trial court left it to the jury to determine as a
question of fact the amount which should be credited to
Heyward on these notes. The jury was charged that the
full face amount of the notes should be credited to
Heyward as payment only if the parties intended the
notes as payment at the time they were received.
Otherwise, it was to give Heyward credit only for such
amounts as D'Agostino had actually received on account
of the notes.
It may be noted, in the first place, that this is another
instance in which no objection was made by appellants
to the charge on the subject. Moreover, the appellants
neglected to call to the attention of the trial court the
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code on which
they now rely.
In any event, however, the charge on this subject was
substantially correct.
Under the common law of Connecticut, the mere giving
of a note does not constitute payment unless it is agreed
that the note should be received as payment. Under the
law prior to the Uniform Commercial Code the burden
was apparently on the defendant maker to establish that
the parties intended the note to be payment. Davidson
v. Bridgeport, 8 Conn. 472 (1831). In fact, acceptance of
a note was presumed to be merely conditional payment.
Brabazon v. Seymour, 42 Conn. 551, 554 (1875).
U.C.C. ¶ 3-802, Conn.Gen.Stat. Ann. § 42a-3-802
(1958) does not appear to have changed the rule on the
presumed intention of the parties except where a bank is
the drawer, maker or acceptor. The questions of
whether the parties intended the notes to be payment,
whether payment was conditional and whether the
original obligation was discharged by the payments
made to the transferees by Heyward and to what extent,
was for the jury. The jury was entitled to find on this
record that the parties did not intend the notes as
payment or to be taken in satisfaction of the underlying
obligations, that therefore the underlying obligations
were not discharged by the satisfaction and surrender of
the instruments and that Heyward was entitled to credit
only for the amount it paid to the transferees and not to
credit for face value. This, in substance, is what was
charged.
VI.
Appellants' remaining contentions require little
discussion.
The argument that it was an abuse of discretion for the
trial court to permit amendment of the complaint "late
[430 F.2d 1087] in the trial" so as to allege a claim in
quantum meruit is devoid of merit. The appellants have
failed to show any prejudice as a result of the
amendment. Moreover, the trial court, in discussing the
motion to amend early in the trial, specifically indicated
it would entertain an application by Heyward for
additional time to produce evidence on the amended
claim, if that became necessary. Heyward made no such
application.
The contention that it was error to deny Heyward's
request to poll the jury upon its verdict on the first
question submitted to it is equally meritless. Heyward
did not request that the jury be polled on its verdict on
the first question when that verdict was returned.
Instead, the request was made only after the jury had
returned a verdict on the second question. If Heyward
had wanted the jury polled on the first question it
should have asked for such a poll when the jury returned
its verdict on that question and not have delayed until
after the jury had reached a verdict on the second
question. The trial court so indicated when it denied
Heyward's application because it was too late.
Finally, appellants' claim that they were prejudiced by
the recesses granted during the course of the trial and
that a new trial is therefore required in the interests of
justice has no substance whatsoever.
While the record in this complex and difficult case is
somewhat confusing, substantial justice was done here.
There was ample evidence that Heyward was badly
behind in its progress payments on the two
subcontracts. The verdicts that (1) Heyward breached
the subcontracts prior to October 19, 1965 and (2) that
Heyward was liable in quantum meruit for the work
performed by D'Agostino in the amount found by the
jury were fully justified by the evidence.
The judgment below is affirmed.
