In its eagerness to correct the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Court today
disregards statutory restrictions on federal-court
jurisdiction, and, in the process, confuses rather than
clarifies long-established principles of res judicata. I
therefore respectfully dissent.
I
Respondent Floyd R. Brown1 filed this class action
(Brown II) against petitioners in California state court.
The complaint [452 U.S. 405] stated four state-law
causes of action: (1) fraud and deceit, (2) unfair business
practices. (3) civil conspiracy, and (4) restitution.
Plaintiffs' Complaint, ¶¶ 11-14, App. 99-101. It alleged
"not less than $600" damages per class member, and in
addition sought "appropriate multiple damages,"
exemplary and punitive damages, interest from date of
injury, attorney's fees and costs, and other relief. Id., at
101-102. All four of the causes of action rested wholly
on California statutory or common law; none rested in
any fashion on federal law.
Nonetheless, petitioners removed the suit to the United
States District Court for the Northern District of
California, where respondent Brown filed a motion to
remand on the ground that his action raised no federal
question within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1441 (b).
Respondent's motion was denied by the District Court,
which stated that "[f]rom start to finish, plaintiffs have
essentially alleged violations by defendants of federal
antitrust laws." App. 192. The court reasoned that
"[a]rtful pleading" by plaintiffs cannot "convert their
essentially federal law claims into state law claims," and
held that respondent's complaint was properly removed
"because [it] concerned federal questions which could
have been originally brought in Federal District Court
without satisfying any minimum amount in
controversy." Ibid. The court then dismissed the action,
holding that, under the doctrine of res judicata, Brown
II was barred by the adverse decision in an earlier suit in
federal court (Brown I) involving "the same parties, the
same alleged offenses, and the same time periods." Ibid.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's
decision not to remand, stating that "[t]he court below
correctly held that the claims presented were federal in
nature." 611 F.2d 1267, 1268 (CA9 1980) (memorandum
on denial of reconsideration). However, the Court of
Appeals reversed the District Court's order of dismissal,
and remanded for trial.
[452 U.S. 406] II
The provision authorizing removal of actions from state
to federal courts on the basis of a federal question2 is
found in 28 U. S. C. § 1441 (b):
"Any civil action of which the district courts have original
jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the
Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be
removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the
parties."
Removability depends solely upon the nature of the
plaintiff's complaint: an action may be removed to
federal court only if a "right or immunity created by the
Constitution or laws of the United States [constitutes]
an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause
of action." Gully v. First National Bank in Meridian, 299
U.S. 109, 112 (1936). An action arising under state law
may not be removed solely because a federal right or
immunity is raised as a defense. Tennessee v. Union &
Planters' Bank, 152 U.S. 454 (1894).
An important corollary is that "the party who brings a
suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon and
therefore does determine whether he will bring a `suit
arising under' the . . . law[s] of the United States" by the
allegations in his complaint. The Fair v. Kohler Die &
Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 25 (1913); accord, Great
Northern R. Co. v. Alexander, 246 U.S. 276, 282 (1918).
Where the plaintiff's claim might [452 U.S. 407] be
brought under either federal or state law, the plaintiff is
normally free to ignore the federal question and rest his
claim solely on the state ground. If he does so, the
defendant has no general right of removal. Jones v.
General Tire & Rubber Co., 541 F.2d 660, 664-665 (CA7
1976); La Chemise Lacoste v. Alligator Co., 506 F.2d
339, 346 (CA3 1974), cert. denied. 421 U.S. 937 (1975);
Warner Bros. Records, Inc. v. R. A. Ridges Distributing
Co., 475 F.2d 262, 264 (CA10 1973); Coditron Corp. v.
AFA Protective Systems, Inc., 392 F.Supp. 158, 160
(SDNY 1975).
This corollary is well grounded in principles of
federalism. So long as States retain authority to legislate
in subject areas in which Congress has legislated without
pre-empting the field, and so long as state courts remain
the preferred forum for interpretation and enforcement
of state law, plaintiffs must be permitted to proceed in
state court under state law. It would do violence to state
autonomy were defendants able to remove state claims
to federal court merely because the plaintiff could have
asserted a federal claim based on the same set of facts
underlying his state claim. As this Court stated in
Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100, 108-
109 (1941):
"The power reserved to the states under the Constitution to
provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may
be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the
Judiciary Articles of the Constitution. `Due regard for the rightful
independence of state governments, which should actuate federal
courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own
jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined.'"
(Quoting Healy v. Ratta, 292 U.S. 263, 270 (1934).)
The general rule that a plaintiff basing his claim solely
on state law thereby avoids removal applies only where
state substantive law has not been pre-empted by federal
law.
"[W]here the plaintiff has a right to relief either under [452 U.S.
408] federal law or under state law as an independent source of that
right, the federal court on removal proceedings may not generally
look beyond the face of the initial pleading in the state action to
determine whether a federal question is presented. In certain areas,
however, this either-or option is no longer available, for Congress
has deemed that federal substantive law should altogether preempt
and supplant state law. In such a case, where Congress has explicitly
said that the exclusive source of a plaintiff's right to relief is to be
federal law, it would be unacceptable to permit that very plaintiff,
by the artful manipulation of the terms of a complaint, to defeat a
clearly enunciated congressional objective." Hearst Corp. v.
Shopping Center Network, Inc., 307 F.Supp. 551, 556 (SDNY 1969)
(emphasis in original) (citation omitted).
The federal court must therefore scrutinize the
complaint in the removed case to determine whether
the action, though ostensibly grounded solely on state
law, is actually grounded on a claim in which federal law
is the exclusive authority. See Sheeran v. General
Electric Co., 593 F.2d 93, 96 (CA9), cert. denied, 444
U.S. 868 (1979); North American Phillips Corp. v.
Emery Air Freight Corp., 579 F.2d 229, 233-234 (CA2
1978); New York v. Local 144, Hotel Nursing Home and
Allied Health Services Union, 410 F.Supp. 225, 226-229
(SDNY 1976).3
[452 U.S. 409] This lawsuit concerns the area of antitrust
in which federal laws have not displaced state law. See
generally Mosk, State Antitrust Enforcement and
Coordination with Federal Enforcement, 21 A. B. A.
Antitrust Section 358, 361-368 (1962). Thus,
respondent Brown had the option of proceeding under
state or federal law, or both. So far as is apparent from
the complaint, which was carefully limited to four
California state-law causes of action, this case arises
wholly without reference to federal law. Under settled
principles of federal jurisdiction, therefore, respondent's
lawsuit should not have been removed to federal court.
See Gully v. First National Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S.,
at 113.
The Court today nonetheless sustains removal of this
action on the ground that "at least some of the claims
had a sufficient federal character to support removal."
Ante, at 397, n. 2. I do not understand what the Court
means by this. Which of the claims are federal in
character? Why are the claims federal in character? In
my view, they are all predicated solely on California
law.4 Certainly, none of them purports to state a claim
under the federal antitrust laws, and the mere fact that
plaintiffs might have chosen to proceed under the
Clayton Act surely does not suffice to transmute their
state claims into federal claims.
The Court relies on what it calls a "factual finding" by
the District Court,5 with which the Court of Appeals
agreed, that "respondents had attempted to avoid
removal jurisdiction by `artful[ly]' casting their
`essentially federal law claims' as state-law claims." Ibid.
But this amounts to no more than [452 U.S. 410] a
pejorative characterization of respondents' decision to
proceed under state rather than federal law. "Artful" or
not, respondents' complaints were not based on any
claim of a federal right or immunity, and were not,
therefore, removable.6
III
Even assuming that this Court and the lower federal
courts have jurisdiction to decide this case, however, I
dissent from the Court's disposition of the res judicata
issue. Having reached out to assume jurisdiction, the
Court inexplicably recoils from deciding the case. The
Court finds it "unnecessary" to reach the question of the
res judicata effect of Brown I on respondents' "state-law
claims." Ante, at 402 (emphasis in original). "It is
enough for our decision here," the Court says, "that
Brown I is res judicata as to respondents' federal-law
claims." Ibid. But respondents raised only state-law
claims; respondents did not raise any federal-law claims.
[452 U.S. 411] Thus, if the Court fails to decide the
disposition of respondents' state-law claims, it decides
nothing. And in doing so, the Court introduces the
possibility—heretofore foreclosed by our decisions7
—that unarticulated theories of recovery may survive an
unconditional dismissal of the lawsuit.
Like JUSTICE BLACKMUN, I would hold that the
dismissal of Brown I is res judicata not only as to every
matter that was actually litigated, but also as to every
ground or theory of recovery that might also have been
presented. See ante, p. 402 (opinion concurring in
judgment); 1B J. Moore & T. Currier, Moore's Federal
Practice ¶ 0.410 [2], p. 1163 (1980). An unqualified
dismissal on the merits of a substantial federal antitrust
claim precludes relitigation of the same claim on a statelaw
theory. Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v.
Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1312-1315
(CA5 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047 (1972); Ford
Motor Co. v. Superior Court, 35 Cal.App.3d 676, 680,
110 Cal.Rptr. 59, 61-62 (1973); see Restatement
(Second) of Judgments § 61.1, Reporter's Note to
Illustration 10, Comment e, pp. 178-179 (Tent. Draft
No. 5, Mar. 10, 1978). The Court's failure to
acknowledge this basic principle can only create doubts
and confusion where none were before, and may
encourage litigants to split their causes of action, state
from federal, in the hope that they might win a second
day in court.
I therefore respectfully dissent, and would vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals with instructions to
remand to the District Court with instructions to
remand to state court.
