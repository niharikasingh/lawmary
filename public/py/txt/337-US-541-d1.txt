The cause of action on which this suit is brought is a
derivative one. Though it belongs to the corporation,
the stockholders are entitled under state law to enforce
it. The measure of the cause of action is the claim which
the corporation has against the alleged wrongdoers.
This New Jersey statute does not add one iota to nor
subtract one iota from that cause of action. It merely
prescribes the method by which stockholders may
enforce it. Each state has numerous regulations
governing the institution of suits in its courts. They may
favor the litigation or they may affect it adversely. But
they do not fall under the principle of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, unless they define, qualify or
delimit the cause of action or otherwise relate to it.
This New Jersey statute, like statutes governing security
for costs, regulates only the procedure for instituting a
particular cause of action and hence need not be applied
in this diversity suit in the federal court. Rule 23 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure defines that procedure
for the federal courts.
