The Court today approves Shady Grove's attempt to
transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award, although
the State creating the right to recover has proscribed
this alchemy. If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York
state court, the 2% interest payment authorized by New
York Ins. Law Ann. § 5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty
for overdue benefits would, by Shady Grove's own
measure, amount to no more than $500. By instead
filing in federal court based on the parties' diverse
citizenship and requesting class certification, Shady
Grove hopes to recover, for the class, statutory damages
of more than $5,000,000. The New York Legislature has
barred this remedy, instructing that, unless specifically
permitted, "an action to recover a penalty, or minimum
measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may
not be maintained as a class action." N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law
Ann. (CPLR) § 901(b) (West 2006). The Court
nevertheless holds that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
23, which prescribes procedures for the conduct of class
actions in federal courts, preempts the application of §
901(b) in diversity suits.
The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New
York's restriction on the availability of statutory
damages. Our decisions, however, caution us to ask,
before undermining state legislation: Is this conflict
really necessary? Cf. Traynor, Is This Conflict Really
Necessary? 37 Tex. L.Rev. 657 (1959). Had the Court
engaged in that inquiry, it would not have read Rule 23
to collide with New York's legitimate interest in keeping
certain monetary awards reasonably bounded. I would
continue to interpret Federal Rules with awareness of,
and sensitivity to, important state regulatory policies.
Because today's judgment radically departs from that
course, I dissent.

A
"Under the Erie doctrine," it is long settled, "federal
courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and
federal procedural law." Gasperini v. Center for
Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135
L.Ed.2d 659 (1996); see Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Justice
Harlan aptly conveyed the importance of the doctrine;
he described Erie as "one of the modern cornerstones of
our federalism, expressing policies that profoundly
touch the allocation of judicial power between the state
and federal systems." Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460,
474, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965) (concurring
opinion). Although we have found Erie's application
"sometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor," Gasperini,
518 U.S. at 427, 116 S.Ct. 2211, two federal statutes
mark our way.
The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal
courts from generating [130 S.Ct. 1461] substantive law
in diversity actions. See Erie, 304 U.S. at 78, 58 S.Ct.
817. Originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of
1789, this restraint serves a policy of prime importance
to our federal system. We have therefore applied the Act
"with an eye alert to ... avoiding disregard of State law."
Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 110, 65 S.Ct.
1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945).
The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,
authorizes us to "prescribe general rules of practice and
procedure" for the federal courts, but with a crucial
restriction: "Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or
modify any substantive right." 28 U.S.C. § 2072.
Pursuant to this statute, we have adopted the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. In interpreting the scope of
the Rules, including, in particular, Rule 23, we have
been mindful of the limits on our authority. See, e.g.,
Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 845, 119 S.Ct.
2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act
counsels against "adventurous application" of Rule 23;
any tension with the Act "is best kept within tolerable
limits."); Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S.
591, 612-613, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997).
See also Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531
U.S. 497, 503-504, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 149 L.Ed.2d 32
(2001).
If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts
with state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with
the Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See
Hanna, 380 U.S. at 469-474, 85 S.Ct. 1136. If, however,
no Federal Rule or statute governs the issue, the Rules
of Decision Act, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That
Act directs federal courts, in diversity cases, to apply
state law when failure to do so would invite forumshopping
and yield markedly disparate litigation
outcomes. See Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 428, 116 S.Ct.
2211; Hanna, 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
Recognizing that the Rules of Decision Act and the
Rules Enabling Act simultaneously frame and inform
the Erie analysis, we have endeavored in diversity suits
to remain safely within the bounds of both
congressional directives.
B
In our prior decisions in point, many of them not
mentioned in the Court's opinion, we have avoided
immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that
would trench on state prerogatives without serving any
countervailing federal interest. "Application of the
Hanna analysis," we have said, "is premised on a `direct
collision' between the Federal Rule and the state law."
Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740, 749-750,
100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980) (quoting Hanna,
380 U.S. at 472, 85 S.Ct. 1136). To displace state law, a
Federal Rule, "when fairly construed," must be
"`sufficiently broad'" so as "to `control the issue' before
the court, thereby leaving no room for the operation of
that law." Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480
U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S.Ct. 967, 94 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (quoting
Walker, 446 U.S. at 749-750, and n. 9, 100 S.Ct. 1978;
emphasis added); cf. Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh
Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 37-38, 108 S.Ct. 2239, 101 L.Ed.2d
22 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("[I]n deciding
whether a federal ... Rule of Procedure encompasses a
particular issue, a broad reading that would create
significant disuniformity between state and federal
courts should be avoided if the text permits.").
[130 S.Ct. 1462] In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court
vigilantly read the Federal Rules to avoid conflict with
state laws. In Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117, 63
S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), for example, the Court
read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative defenses,
to control only the manner of pleading the listed
defenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in
such cases, Palmer held, state law controls.
Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &
Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed.
1520 (1949), the Court ruled that state law determines
when a diversity suit commences for purposes of tolling
the state limitations period. Although Federal Rule 3
specified that "[a] civil action is commenced by filing a
complaint with the court," we held that the Rule did not
displace a state law that tied an action's commencement
to service of the summons. Id. at 531-533, 69 S.Ct. 1233.
The "cause of action [wa]s created by local law," the
Court explained, therefore "the measure of it [wa]s to be
found only in local law." Id. at 533, 69 S.Ct. 1233.
Similarly in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,
337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), the
Court held applicable in a diversity action a state statute
requiring plaintiffs, as a prerequisite to pursuit of a
stockholder's derivative action, to post a bond as
security for costs. At the time of the litigation, Rule 23,
now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff's institution of a
derivative action in federal court. Although the Federal
Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder's
maintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no
conflict between the Rule and the state statute in
question; the requirements of both could be enforced,
the Court observed. See id., at 556, 69 S.Ct. 1221.
Burdensome as the security-for-costs requirement may
be, Cohen made plain, suitors could not escape the
upfront outlay by resorting to the federal court's
diversity jurisdiction.
In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, "the
scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing
party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule
which covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded
the enforcement of state law." 380 U.S. at 470, 85 S.Ct.
1136. In Hanna itself, the Court found the clash
"unavoidable," ibid.; the petitioner had effected service
of process as prescribed by Federal Rule 4(d)(1), but that
"how-to" method did not satisfy the special
Massachusetts law applicable to service on an executor
or administrator. Even as it rejected the Massachusetts
prescription in favor of the federal procedure, however,
"[t]he majority in Hanna recognized ... that federal rules
... must be interpreted by the courts applying them, and
that the process of interpretation can and should reflect
an awareness of legitimate state interests." R. Fallon, J.
Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System
593 (6th ed.2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).
Following Hanna, we continued to "interpre[t] the
federal rules to avoid conflict with important state
regulatory policies." Hart & Wechsler 593. In Walker,
the Court took up the question whether Ragan should
be overruled; we held, once again, that Federal Rule 3
does not directly conflict with state rules governing the
time when an action commences for purposes of tolling
a limitations period. 446 U.S. at 749-752, 100 S.Ct. 1978.
Rule 3, we said, addresses only "the date from which
various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin
to run," id. at 751, 100 S.Ct. 1978, and does not
"purpor[t] to displace state tolling rules," id. at 750-751,
100 S.Ct. 1978. Significant state policy interests would
be frustrated, we observed, [130 S.Ct. 1463] were we to
read Rule 3 as superseding the state rule, which required
actual service on the defendant to stop the clock on the
statute of limitations. Id. at 750-752, 100 S.Ct. 1978.
We were similarly attentive to a State's regulatory policy
in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the standard
for determining when the large size of a jury verdict
warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts alike had
generally employed a "shock the conscience" test in
reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U.S. at
422, 116 S.Ct. 2211. Federal courts did so pursuant to
Federal Rule 59(a) which, as worded at the time of
Gasperini, instructed that a trial court could grant a new
trial "for any of the reasons for which new trials have
heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts
of the United States." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West
1995). In an effort to provide greater control, New York
prescribed procedures under which jury verdicts would
be examined to determine whether they "deviate[d]
materially from what would be reasonable
compensation." See Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 423-425, 116
S.Ct. 2211 (quoting CPLR § 5501(c)). This Court held
that Rule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court
accommodation of New York's invigorated test.
Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claimpreclusive
effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing
a diversity action on the basis of a California statute of
limitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff
renewed the same fray against the same defendant in a
Maryland state court. (Plaintiff chose Maryland because
that State's limitations period had not yet run.) We held
that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an
involuntary dismissal "operate[d] as an adjudication on
the merits," did not bar maintenance of the renewed
action in Maryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded
the Maryland courts from entertaining the case, we said,
"would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of
the Rules Enabling Act," 531 U.S. at 503, 121 S.Ct. 1021,
and "would in many cases violate [Erie's] federalism
principle," id. at 504, 121 S.Ct. 1021.
In sum, both before and after Hanna, the abovedescribed
decisions show, federal courts have been
cautioned by this Court to "interpre[t] the Federal
Rules... with sensitivity to important state interests,"
Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, and a
will "to avoid conflict with important state regulatory
policies," id. at 438, n. 22, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (internal
quotation marks omitted).2 The Court [130 S.Ct. 1464]
veers away from that approach—and conspicuously, its
most recent reiteration in Gasperini, ante at 1441, n.
7—in favor of a mechanical reading of Federal Rules,
insensitive to state interests and productive of discord.
C
Our decisions instruct over and over again that, in the
adjudication of diversity cases, state interests—whether
advanced in a statute, e.g., Cohen, or a procedural rule,
e.g., Gasperini—warrant our respectful consideration.
Yet today, the Court gives no quarter to New York's
limitation on statutory damages and requires the lower
courts to thwart the regulatory policy at stake: To
prevent excessive damages, New York's law controls the
penalty to which a defendant may be exposed in a single
suit. The story behind § 901(b)'s enactment deserves
telling.
In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New
York proposed a new class-action statute designed "to
set up a flexible, functional scheme" that would provide
"an effective, but controlled group remedy." Judicial
Conference Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N.Y.
Laws pp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted,
the legislation addressed only the procedural aspects of
class actions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites
for certification, eventually codified at § 901(a), that
closely tracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR §
901(a) (requiring, for class certification, numerosity,
predominance, typicality, adequacy of representation,
and superiority).
While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New
York Legislature's hopper, "various groups advocated
for the addition of a provision that would prohibit class
action plaintiffs from being awarded a statutorilycreated
penalty ... except when expressly authorized in
the pertinent statute." Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 8
N.Y.3d 204, 211, 831 N.Y.S.2d 760, 863 N.E.2d 1012,
1015 (2007). These constituents "feared that recoveries
beyond actual damages could lead to excessively harsh
results." Ibid. "They also argued that there was no need
to permit class actions ... [because] statutory penalties ...
provided an aggrieved party with a sufficient economic
incentive to pursue a claim." Ibid. Such penalties,
constituents observed, often far exceed a plaintiff's
actual damages. "When lumped together," they argued,
"penalties and class actions produce overkill."

State Council of Retail Merchants, Inc., to J. Gribetz,
Executive Chamber (June 4, 1975) (Legislative Report),
Bill Jacket, L. 1975, Ch. 207.
Aiming to avoid "annihilating punishment of the
defendant," the New York Legislature amended the
proposed statute to bar the recovery of statutory
damages in class actions. V. Alexander, Practice
Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney's
Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006)
(internal quotation marks omitted). In his signing
statement, Governor Hugh Carey stated that the new
statute "empowers the court to prevent abuse of the
class action device and provides a controlled remedy."
Memorandum on Approving L. 1975, Ch. 207,
reprinted in 1975 N.Y. Laws, at 1748 (emphasis added).
"[T]he final bill ... was the result of a compromise
among competing interests." Sperry, 8 N.Y.3d at 211,
831 N.Y.S.2d 760, 863 N.E.2d at 1015. Section 901(a)
allows [130 S.Ct. 1465] courts leeway in deciding
whether to certify a class, but § 901(b) rejects the use of
the class mechanism to pursue the particular remedy of
statutory damages. The limitation was not designed
with the fair conduct or efficiency of litigation in mind.
Indeed, suits seeking statutory damages are arguably
best suited to the class device because individual proof of
actual damages is unnecessary. New York's decision
instead to block class-action proceedings for statutory
damages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means
to a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant's
liability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the
exorbitant inflation of penalties—remedies the New
York Legislature created with individual suits in mind.3
D
Shady Grove contends—and the Court today
agrees—that Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York's
prohibition on the recovery of statutory damages in
class actions. The Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes,
states that Shady Grove's suit "may be" maintained as a
class action, which conflicts with § 901(b)'s instruction
that it "may not" so proceed. Ante at 1437 (internal
quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted).
Accordingly, the Court insists, § 901(b) "cannot apply in
diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires." Ibid.
Concluding that Rule 23 does not violate the Rules
Enabling Act, the Court holds that the federal provision
controls Shady Grove's ability to seek, on behalf of a
class, a statutory penalty of over $5,000,000. Ante at
1442-1444 (plurality opinion); ante at 1457-1460
(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).
The Court, I am convinced, finds conflict where none is
necessary. Mindful of the history behind § 901(b)'s
enactment, the thrust of our precedent, and the
substantive-rights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act,
I conclude, as did the Second Circuit and every District
Court to have considered the question in any detail,4
that Rule 23 does not collide with § 901(b). As the
Second Circuit well understood, Rule 23 prescribes the
considerations relevant to class certification and
postcertification proceedings—but it does not command
that a particular remedy be available when a party sues
in a representative capacity. See 549 F.3d 137, 143
(2008).5 Section 901(b), [130 S.Ct. 1466] in contrast,
trains on that latter issue. Sensibly read, Rule 23 governs
procedural aspects of class litigation, but allows state law
to control the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff
may pursue.
In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing
a claim for relief, while § 901(b) defines the dimensions
of the claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that §
901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than
retail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have
embedded the limitation in every provision creating a
cause of action for which a penalty is authorized; §
901(b) operates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as
much a part of the delineation of the claim for relief as it
would be were it included claim by claim in the New
York Code.
The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit
"may" or "may not" be maintained as a class action. See
ante at 1437-1439. Putting the question that way, the
Court does not home in on the reason why. Rule 23
authorizes class treatment for suits satisfying its
prerequisites because the class mechanism generally
affords a fair and efficient way to aggregate claims for
adjudication. Section 901(b) responds to an entirely
different concern; it does not allow class members to
recover statutory damages because the New York
Legislature considered the result of adjudicating such
claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The fair and efficient
conduct of class litigation is the legitimate concern of
Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of state law,
however, is the legitimate concern of the State's
lawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely,
The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L.Rev. 693, 722
(1974) (It is relevant "whether the state provision
embodies a substantive policy or represents only a
procedural disagreement with the federal rulemakers
respecting the fairest and most efficient way of
conducting litigation.").
Suppose, for example, that a State, wishing to cap
damages in class actions at $1,000,000, enacted a statute
providing that "a suit to recover more than $1,000,000
may not be maintained as a class action." Under the
Court's reasoning—which attributes dispositive
significance to the words "may not be
maintained"—Rule 23 would preempt this provision,
nevermind that Congress, by authorizing the
promulgation of rules of procedure for federal courts,
surely did not intend to displace state-created ceilings on
damages.7 The Court suggests [130 S.Ct. 1467] that the
analysis might differ if the statute "limit[ed] the
remedies available in an existing class action," ante at
1439, such that Rule 23 might not conflict with a state
statute prescribing that "no more than $1,000,000 may
be recovered in a class action." There is no real
difference in the purpose and intended effect of these
two hypothetical statutes. The notion that one directly
impinges on Rule 23's domain, while the other does not,
fundamentally misperceives the office of Rule 23.8
The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23
and § 901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended
that a federal court sitting in diversity can accord due
respect to both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs
seeking to vindicate claims for which the State has
provided a statutory penalty may pursue relief through a
class action if they forgo statutory damages and instead
seek actual damages or injunctive or declaratory relief;
any putative class member who objects can opt out and
pursue actual damages, if available, and the statutory
penalty in an individual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The
Radec Corp., 260 F.R.D. 38, 55 (W.D.N.Y. 2009);
Brzychnalski v. Unesco, Inc., 35 F.Supp.2d 351, 353
(S.D.N.Y.1999).9 See also Alexander, Practice
Commentaries, at 105 ("Even if a statutory penalty or
minimum recovery is involved, most courts hold that it
can be waived, thus confining the class recovery to
actual damages and eliminating the bar of CPLR
901(b)."). In this manner, the Second Circuit explained,
"Rule 23's procedural requirements for class actions can
be applied along with the substantive requirement of
CPLR 901(b)." 549 F.3d, at 144. In sum, while phrased
as responsive to the question whether certain class
actions may begin, § 901(b) is unmistakably aimed at
controlling how those [130 S.Ct. 1468] actions must end.
On that remedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.
Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves § 901(b) in control of
the remedial issue at the core of this case should be
dispelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna,
which counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and
cautions against stretching a rule to cover every
situation it could conceivably reach.10 The Court states
that "[t]here is no reason ... to read Rule 23 as
addressing only whether claims made eligible for class
treatment by some other law should be certified as class
actions." Ante at 1438. To the contrary, Palmer, Ragan,
Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and Semtek provide good
reason to look to the law that creates the right to
recover. See supra at 1437-1439. That is plainly so on a
more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there any
reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief
when the State that created the remedy disallows its
pursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our
federal system should give.
Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain
penalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class
relief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for
certain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum
recovery. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(2)(B) (Truth in
Lending Act) ("[I]n the case of a class action... no
minimum recovery shall be applicable."); §
1693m(a)(2)(B) (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) (same);
12 U.S.C. § 4010(a)(2)(B)(i) (Expedited Fund
Availability Act) (same). Today's judgment denies to the
States the full power Congress has to keep certain
monetary awards within reasonable bounds. Cf. Beard v.
Kindler, 558 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 612, 618-19, ___
L.Ed.2d ___ (2009) ("In light of ... federalism and comity
concerns ... it would seem particularly strange to
disregard state ... rules that are substantially similar to
those to which we give full force in our own courts.").
States may hesitate to create determinate statutory
penalties in the future if they are impotent to prevent
federal-court distortion of the remedy they have
shaped.11
By finding a conflict without considering whether Rule
23 rationally should be read to avoid any collision, the
Court unwisely and unnecessarily retreats from the
federalism principles undergirding Erie. Had the Court
reflected on the respect for state regulatory interests
endorsed in our decisions, it would have found no cause
to interpret Rule 23 so woodenly—and every [130 S.Ct.
1469] reason not to do so. Cf. Traynor, 37 Tex. L.Rev.,
at 669 ("It is bad enough for courts to prattle
unintelligibly about choice of law, but unforgiveable
when inquiry might have revealed that there was no real
conflict.").
II
Because I perceive no unavoidable conflict between Rule
23 and § 901(b), I would decide this case by inquiring
"whether application of the [state] rule would have so
important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of
the litigants that failure to [apply] it would be likely to
cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court." Hanna, 380
U.S. at 468, n. 9, 85 S.Ct. 1136. See Gasperini, 518 U.S.
at 428, 116 S.Ct. 2211.
Seeking to pretermit that inquiry, Shady Grove urges
that the class-action bar in § 901(b) must be regarded as
"procedural" because it is contained in the CPLR, which
"govern[s] the procedure in civil judicial proceedings in
all courts of the state." Brief for Petitioner 34 (quoting
CPLR § 101; emphasis in original). Placement in the
CPLR is hardly dispositive. The provision held
"substantive" for Erie purposes in Gasperini is also
contained in the CPLR (§ 5501(c)), as are limitations
periods, § 201 et seq., prescriptions plainly "substantive"
for Erie purposes however they may be characterized for
other purposes, see York, 326 U.S. at 109-112, 65 S.Ct.
1464. See also, e.g., 1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict
of Laws § 133, Reporter's Note, p. 369 (1969)
(hereinafter Restatement) ("Under the rule of Erie ... the
federal courts have classified the burden of persuasion as
to contributory negligence as a matter of substantive law
that is governed by the rule of the State in which they sit
even though the courts of that State have characterized
their rule as procedural for choice-of-law purposes.");
Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" in the Conflict of
Laws, 42 Yale L.J. 333 (1933).
Shady Grove also ranks § 901(b) as "procedural" because
"nothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to
rights of action based on New York state law, as
opposed to federal law or the law of other states";
instead it "applies to actions seeking penalties under any
statute." Brief for Petitioner 35-36. See also ante at
1457-1458 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (Section 901(b) cannot "be
understood as a rule that... serves the function of
defining New York's rights or remedies" because its
"text ... expressly and unambiguously applies not only to
claims based on New York law but also to claims based
on federal law or the law of any other State.").
It is true that § 901(b) is not specifically limited to claims
arising under New York law. But neither is it expressly
extended to claims arising under foreign law. The rule
prescribes, without elaboration either way, that "an
action to recover a penalty... may not be maintained as a
class action." We have often recognized that "general
words" appearing in a statute may, in fact, have limited
application; "[t]he words `any person or persons,'" for
example, "are broad enough to comprehend every
human being. But general words must not only be
limited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state, but
also to those objects to which the legislature intended to
apply them." United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610,
631, 4 L.Ed. 471 (1818) (opinion for the Court by
Marshall, C. J.). See also Small v. United States, 544 U.S.
385, 388, 125 S.Ct. 1752, 161 L.Ed.2d 651 (2005) ("In
law, a legislature that uses the statutory phrase `any
person' may or may not mean to include `persons'
outside the jurisdiction of the state." (some internal
quotation marks omitted)); Flora v. United States, 362
U.S. 145, 149, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960) [130
S.Ct. 1470] (The term "`any sum' is a catchall [phrase,] ...
but to say this is not to define what it catches.").
Moreover, Shady Grove overlooks the most likely
explanation for the absence of limiting language: New
York legislators make law with New York plaintiffs and
defendants in mind, i.e., as if New York were the
universe. See Baxter, Choice of Law and the Federal
System, 16 Stan. L.Rev. 1, 11 (1963) ("[L]awmakers
often speak in universal terms but must be understood
to speak with reference to their constituents."); cf. Smith
v. United States, 507 U.S. 197, 204, n. 5, 113 S.Ct. 1178,
122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993) (presumption against
extraterritoriality rooted in part in "the commonsense
notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic
concerns in mind").
The point was well put by Brainerd Currie in his
seminal article on governmental interest analysis in
conflict-of-laws cases. The article centers on a nowarchaic
Massachusetts law that prevented married
women from binding themselves by contract as sureties
for their husbands. Discussing whether the
Massachusetts prescription applied to transactions
involving foreign factors (a foreign forum, foreign place
of contracting, or foreign parties), Currie observed:
"When the Massachusetts legislature addresses itself to the problem
of married women as sureties, the undeveloped image in its mind is
that of Massachusetts married women, husbands, creditors,
transactions, courts, and judgments. In the history of AngloAmerican
law the domestic case has been normal, the conflict-oflaws
case marginal." Married Women's Contracts: A Study in
Conflict-of-Laws Method, 25 U. Chi. L.Rev. 227, 231 (1958)
(emphasis added).
Shady Grove's suggestion that States must specifically
limit their laws to domestic rights of action if they wish
their enactments to apply in federal diversity litigation
misses the obvious point: State legislators generally do
not focus on an interstate setting when drafting
statutes.12
Shady Grove also observes that a New York court has
applied § 901(b) to a federal claim for relief under the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA),
47 U.S.C. § 227, see Rudgayzer & Gratt v. Cape
Canaveral Tour & Travel, Inc., 22 App. Div.3d 148, 799
N.Y.S.2d 795 (2005), thus revealing § 901(b)'s
"procedural" cast. Brief for Petitioner 36. We note first
that the TCPA itself calls for the application of state law.
See Rudgayzer, 22 App. Div.3d, at 149-150, 799
N.Y.S.2d, at 796-797 (federal action authorized in state
court "if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of the
court of [the] State" (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3))).
See also Gottlieb v. Carnival Corp., 436 F.3d 335, 342
(2d Cir.2006) (SOTOMAYOR, J.) [130 S.Ct. 1471]
("Congress sought, via the TCPA, to enact the
functional equivalent of a state law."). The TCPA, the
Supreme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus
"carves out an exception to th[e] general rule" that
"when Erie ... is reversed ..., a state court hearing a
federal case is normally required to apply federal
substantive law": "Under § 227(b)(3) ... it is state
substantive law that determines, as a preliminary
matter, whether a federal action under the act may be
brought in state court." Weber v. U.S. Sterling
Securities, Inc., 282 Conn. 722, 736, 924 A.2d 816, 826
(2007) (in TCPA action governed by New York
substantive law, § 901(b) applied even though the claim
was pursued in Connecticut state court).
Moreover, statutes qualify as "substantive" for Erie
purposes even when they have "procedural" thrusts as
well. See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U.S, at 555, 69 S.Ct. 1221; cf.
Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 536-538,
and n. 1, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949) (holding
diversity case must be dismissed based on state statute
that, by its terms, governed only proceedings in state
court). Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.
They supply "substantive" law in diversity suits, see
York, 326 U.S. at 109-112, 65 S.Ct. 1464, even though,
as Shady Grove acknowledges, state courts often apply
the forum's limitations period as a "procedural" bar to
claims arising under the law of another State, see Reply
Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17. See also
Restatement §§ 142-143 (when adjudicating a foreign
cause of action, State may use either its own or the
foreign jurisdiction's statute of limitations, whichever is
shorter). Similarly, federal courts sitting in diversity give
effect to state laws governing the burden of proving
contributory negligence, see Palmer v. Hoffman, 318
U.S. 109, 117, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), yet state
courts adjudicating foreign causes of action often apply
their own local law to this issue. See Restatement § 133
and Reporter's Note.
In short, Shady Grove's effort to characterize § 901(b) as
simply "procedural" cannot successfully elide this
fundamental norm: When no federal law or rule is
dispositive of an issue, and a state statute is outcome
affective in the sense our cases on Erie (pre and postHanna)
develop, the Rules of Decision Act commands
application of the State's law in diversity suits.
Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 428, 116 S.Ct. 2211; Hanna, 380
U.S. at 468, n. 9, 85 S.Ct. 1136; York, 326 U.S. at 109, 65
S.Ct. 1464. As this case starkly demonstrates, if federal
courts exercising diversity jurisdiction are compelled by
Rule 23 to award statutory penalties in class actions
while New York courts are bound by § 901(b)'s
proscription, "substantial variations between state and
federal [money judgments] may be expected." Gasperini,
518 U.S. at 430, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (quoting Hanna, 380 U.S.
at 467-468, 85 S.Ct. 1136 (internal quotation marks
omitted)). The "variation" here is indeed "substantial."
Shady Grove seeks class relief that is ten thousand times
greater than the individual remedy available to it in state
court. As the plurality acknowledges, ante at 1448,
forum shopping will undoubtedly result if a plaintiff
need only file in federal instead of state court to seek a
massive monetary award explicitly barred by state law.
See Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 431, 116 S.Ct. 2211 ("Erie
precludes a recovery in federal court significantly larger
than the recovery that would have been tolerated in
state court.").13 The "accident of diversity of [130 S.Ct.
1472] citizenship," Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.,
313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941),
should not subject a defendant to such augmented
liability. See Hanna, 380 U.S. at 467, 85 S.Ct. 1136 ("The
Erie rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would
be unfair for the character or result of a litigation
materially to differ because the suit had been brought in
a federal court.").
It is beyond debate that "a statutory cap on damages
would supply substantive law for Erie purposes."
Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 428, 116 S.Ct. 2211. See also id. at
439-440, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) ("A
state-law ceiling on allowable damages ... is a substantive
rule of decision that federal courts must apply in
diversity cases governed by New York law."); id. at 464,
116 S.Ct. 2211 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("State
substantive law controls what injuries are compensable
and in what amount."). In Gasperini, we determined
that New York's standard for measuring the alleged
excessiveness of a jury verdict was designed to provide a
control analogous to a damages cap. Id. at 429, 116 S.Ct.
2211. The statute was framed as "a procedural
instruction," we noted, "but the State's objective [wa]s
manifestly substantive." Ibid.
Gasperini's observations apply with full force in this
case. By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a
class action, § 901(b) controls a defendant's maximum
liability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial
provision could have been written as an explicit cap: "In
any class action seeking statutory damages, relief is
limited to the amount the named plaintiff would have
recovered in an individual suit." That New York's
Legislature used other words to express the very same
meaning should be inconsequential.
We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,
in a diversity action, state-law limitations on statecreated
remedies. See Woods, 337 U.S. at 538, 69 S.Ct.
1235 (in a diversity case, a plaintiff "barred from
recovery in the state court ... should likewise be barred
in the federal court"); York, 326 U.S. at 108-109, 65
S.Ct. 1464 (federal court sitting in diversity "cannot
afford recovery if the right to recover is made
unavailable by the State nor can it substantively affect
the enforcement of the right as given by the State"). Just
as Erie precludes a federal court from entering a
deficiency judgment when a State has "authoritatively
announced that [such] judgments cannot be secured
within its borders," Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183,
191, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947), so too Erie
should prevent a federal court from awarding statutory
penalties aggregated through a class action when New
York prohibits this recovery. See also Ragan, 337 U.S. at
533, 69 S.Ct. 1233 ("Where local law qualifies or
abridges [a claim], the federal court must follow suit.
Otherwise there is a different measure of the cause of
action in one court than in the other, and the principle
of Erie ... is transgressed."). In sum, because "New York
substantive law governs [this] claim for relief, New
York law ... guide[s] the allowable damages." Gasperini,
518 U.S. at 437, 116 S.Ct. 2211.14
[130 S.Ct. 1473] III
The Court's erosion of Erie's federalism grounding
impels me to point out the large irony in today's
judgment. Shady Grove is able to pursue its claim in
federal court only by virtue of the recent enactment of
the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U.S.C.
§ 1332(d). In CAFA, Congress opened federal-court
doors to state-law-based class actions so long as there is
minimal diversity, at least 100 class members, and at
least $5,000,000 in controversy. Ibid. By providing a
federal forum, Congress sought to check what it
considered to be the overreadiness of some state courts
to certify class actions. See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 109-14, p. 4
(2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers from "gam[ing] the
procedural rules [to] keep nationwide or multi-state
class actions in state courts whose judges have
reputations for readily certifying classes." (internal
quotation marks omitted)); id. at 22 (disapproving "the
`I never met a class action I didn't like' approach to class
certification" that "is prevalent in state courts in some
localities"). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer—
not more—class actions overall. Congress surely never
anticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a
mecca for suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched:
class actions seeking state-created penalties for claims
arising under state law—claims that would be barred
from class treatment in the State's own courts. Cf.
Woods, 337 U.S. at 537, 69 S.Ct. 1235 ("[T]he policy of
Erie ... preclude[s] maintenance in ... federal court... of
suits to which the State ha[s] closed its courts.").15

I would continue to approach Erie questions in a
manner mindful of the purposes underlying the Rules of
Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act, faithful to
precedent, and respectful of important state interests. I
would therefore hold that the New York Legislature's
limitation on the recovery of statutory damages applies
in this case, and would affirm the Second Circuit's
judgment.
