A state Administrative Law Judge determined that
petitioner University of Tennessee (hereafter petitioner
or University) was not motivated by racial prejudice in
seeking to discharge respondent. The question
presented is whether this finding is entitled to preclusive
effect in federal court, where respondent has raised
discrimination claims under various civil rights laws,
including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78
Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. 
§
 2000e et seq., and 42
U. S. C. 
§
 1983.
I
In 1981, petitioner informed respondent, a black
employee of the University's Agricultural Extension
Service, that he would be discharged for inadequate
work performance and misconduct on the job.
Respondent requested a hearing under the Tennessee
Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn. Code
Ann. 
§
 4-5-101 et seq. (1985), to contest his proposed
termination. Prior to the start of the hearing,
respondent also filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging
that his proposed discharge was racially motivated and
seeking relief under Title VII and other civil rights
statutes, including 42 
[478 U.S. 791]
 U. S. C. 
§
 1983.
1
The relief sought included damages, an injunction
prohibiting respondent's discharge, and classwide relief
from alleged patterns of discrimination by petitioner.
The District Court initially entered a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the University from taking
any job action against respondent, but later lifted this
order and permitted the state administrative proceeding
to go forward. App. to Pet. for Cert. A27. There
followed a hearing at which an administrative assistant
to the University's Vice President for Agriculture
presided as an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The
focus of the hearing was on 10 particular charges that
the University gave as grounds for respondent's
discharge. Respondent denied these charges, which he
contended were motivated by racial prejudice, and also
argued that the University's subjecting him to the
charges violated his rights under the Constitution, Title
VII, and other federal statutes. The ALJ held that he
lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate respondent's federal
civil rights claims, but did allow respondent to present,
as an affirmative defense, evidence that the charges
against him were actually motivated by racial prejudice
and hence not a proper basis for his proposed discharge.
Id., at A44-45.
After hearing extensive evidence,
2 
 the ALJ found that
the University had proved some but not all of the
charges against respondent, and that the charges were
not racially motivated. Id., at A177-179. Concluding that
the proposed discharge of respondent was too severe a
penalty, the ALJ ordered him transferred to a new
assignment with supervisors other than those with
whom he had experienced conflicts. Id., at A179-181.
Respondent appealed to the University's 
[478 U.S. 792]
Vice President for Agriculture, who affirmed the ALJ's
ruling. Id., at A33-35. The Vice President stated that his
review of the record persuaded him that the proposed
discharge of respondent had not been racially motivated.
Id., at A34.
Respondent did not seek review of these administrative
proceedings in the Tennessee courts; instead, he
returned to federal court to pursue his civil rights
claims. There, petitioner moved for summary judgment
on the ground that respondent's suit was an improper
collateral attack on the ALJ's ruling, which petitioner
contended was entitled to preclusive effect. The District
Court agreed, holding that the civil rights statutes on
which respondent relied "were not intended to afford
the plaintiff a means of relitigating what plaintiff has
heretofore litigated over a five-month period." Id., at
A32.
Respondent appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the
District Court's judgment. 766 F.2d 982 (1985). As
regards respondent's Title VII claim, the Court of
Appeals looked for guidance to our decision in Kremer
v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461 (1982).
3
While Kremer teaches that final state-court judgments
are entitled to full faith and credit in Title VII actions, it
indicates that unreviewed determinations by state
agencies stand on a different footing. The 
[478 U.S. 793]
Sixth Circuit found the following passage from Kremer
directly on point:
"EEOC review [pursuant to 42 U. S. C. 
§
 2000e-5(b)] of
discrimination charges previously rejected by state agencies would
be pointless if the federal courts were bound by such agency
decisions. Batiste v. Furnco Constr. Corp., 503 F.2d 447, 450, n. 1
(CA7 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 928 (1975). Nor is it plausible to
suggest that Congress intended federal courts to be bound further
by state administrative decisions than by decisions of the EEOC.
Since it is settled that decisions by the EEOC do not preclude a trial
de novo in federal court, it is clear that unreviewed administrative
determinations by state agencies also should not preclude such
review even if such a decision were to be afforded preclusive effect
in a State's own courts. Garner v. Giarrusso, 571 F.2d 1330 (CA5
1978), Batiste v. Furnco Constr. Corp., supra; Cooper v. Philip
Morris, Inc., 464 F.2d 9 (CA6 1972); Voutsis v. Union Carbide
Corp., 452 F.2d 889 (CA2 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 918 (1972)."
Id., at 470, n. 7.
The court accordingly held that res judicata did not
foreclose a trial de novo on respondent's Title VII claim.
The Sixth Circuit found the question of applying
preclusion principles to respondent's claims under 
§
1983 and other civil rights statutes a more difficult
question. It held that 28 U. S. C. 
§
 1738,
4 
 which
concerns the preclusive effect of "judicial 
[478 U.S. 794]
proceedings of any [state] court," does not require that
federal courts be bound by the unreviewed findings of
state administrative agencies. The court also declined to
fashion a federal common law of preclusion, declaring
that "[a]t least implicit in the legislative history of
section 1983 is the recognition that state determination
of issues relevant to constitutional adjudication is not an
adequate substitute for full access to federal court." 766
F. 2d, at 992. The court recognized that a similar
argument for denying res judicata effect to state-court
judgments in subsequent 
§
 1983 actions was rejected in
Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90 (1980), and Migra v.
Warren City School District Board of Education, 465
U.S. 75 (1984), but distinguished those cases as based on
the explicit command of 
§
 1738.
We granted certiorari to consider petitioner's
contention that the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that
state administrative factfinding is never entitled to
preclusive effect in actions under Title VII or the
Reconstruction civil rights statutes. 474 U.S. 1004
(1985).
II
Title 28 U. S. C. 
§
 1738 governs the preclusive effect to
be given the judgments and records of state courts, and
is not applicable to the unreviewed state administrative
factfinding at issue in this case. However, we have
frequently fashioned federal common-law rules of
preclusion in the absence of a governing statute. See e.
g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979);
Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., v. University of
Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313 (1971); Chicot County
Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371
(1940); Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165 (1938); Gunter v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U.S. 273, 289-291
(1906). Although 
§
 1738 is a governing statute with 
[478
U.S. 795]
 regard to the judgments and records of state
courts, because 
§
 1738 antedates the development of
administrative agencies it clearly does not represent a
congressional determination that the decisions of state
administrative agencies should not be given preclusive
effect. Accordingly, we will consider whether a rule of
preclusion is appropriate, first with respect to
respondent's Title VII claim, and next with respect to
his claims under the Constitution and the
Reconstruction civil rights statutes.
III
Under 42 U. S. C. 
§
 2000e-5(b), the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in investigating
discrimination charges, must give "substantial weight to
final findings and orders made by State or local
authorities in proceedings commenced under State or
local [employment discrimination] law." As we noted in
Kremer, 456 U. S., at 470, n. 7, it would make little sense
for Congress to write such a provision if state agency
findings were entitled to preclusive effect in Title VII
actions in federal court.
Moreover, our decision in Chandler v. Roudebush, 425
U.S. 840 (1976), strongly supports respondent's
contention that Congress intended one in his position to
have a trial de novo on his Title VII claim. In Chandler,
we held that a federal employee whose discrimination
claim was rejected by her employing agency after an
administrative hearing was entitled to a trial de novo in
federal court on her Title VII claim. After reviewing in
considerable detail the language of Title VII and the
history of the 1972 amendments to the statute, we
concluded:
"The legislative history of the 1972 amendments reinforces the
plain meaning of the statute and confirms that Congress intended
to accord federal employees the same right to a trial de novo
[following administrative proceedings] as is enjoyed by private-
sector employees and employees of state governments and political
subdivisions 
[478 U.S. 796]
 under the amended Civil Rights Act of
1964." Id., at 848.
Like the plaintiff in Chandler, the respondent in this
case pursued his Title VII action following an
administrative proceeding at which the employing
agency rejected a discrimination claim. It would be
contrary to the rationale of Chandler to apply res
judicata to deny respondent a trial de novo on his Title
VII claim.
Invoking the presumption against implied repeal,
petitioner distinguishes Chandler as involving a federal
agency determination not entitled to full faith and credit
under 
§
 1738. Reply Brief for Petitioners 16. This
argument is based on the erroneous premise that 
§
 1738
applies to state administrative proceedings. See Part II,
supra. The question actually before us is whether a
common-law rule of preclusion would be consistent
with Congress' intent in enacting Title VII. On the basis
of our analysis in Kremer and Chandler of the language
and legislative history of Title VII, we conclude that the
Sixth Circuit correctly held that Congress did not intend
unreviewed state administrative proceedings to have
preclusive effect on Title VII claims.

IV
This Court has held that 
§
 1738 requires that state-court
judgments be given both issue and claim preclusive
effect in subsequent actions under 42 U. S. C. 
§
 1983.
Allen v. McCurry, supra (issue preclusion); Migra v.
Warren City School District Board of Education, supra
(claim preclusion). Those decisions are not controlling
in this case, where 
§
 1738 does not apply; nonetheless,
they support the view that Congress, 
[478 U.S. 797]
 in
enacting the Reconstruction civil rights statutes, did not
intend to create an exception to general rules of
preclusion. As we stated in Allen:
"[N]othing in the language of 
§
 1983 remotely expresses any
congressional intent to contravene the common-law rules of
preclusion or to repeal the express statutory requirements of the
predecessor of 28 U. S. C. 
§
 1738. . . .
"Moreover, the legislative history of 
§
 1983 does not in any clear
way suggest that Congress intended to repeal or restrict the
traditional doctrines of preclusion." 449 U. S., at 97-98.
The Court's discussion in Allen suggests that it would
have reached the same result even in the absence of 
§
1738. We also see no reason to suppose that Congress,
in enacting the Reconstruction civil rights statutes,
wished to foreclose the adaptation of traditional
principles of preclusion to such subsequent
developments as the burgeoning use of administrative
adjudication in the 20th century.
We have previously recognized that it is sound policy to
apply principles of issue preclusion to the factfinding of
administrative bodies acting in a judicial capacity. In a
unanimous decision in United States v. Utah
Construction & Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394 (1966), we
held that the factfinding of the Advisory Board of
Contract Appeals was binding in a subsequent action in
the Court of Claims involving a contract dispute
between the same parties. We explained:
"Although the decision here rests upon the agreement of the parties
as modified by the Wunderlich Act, we note that the result we
reach is harmonious with general principles of collateral estoppel.
Occasionally courts have used language to the effect that res judicata
principles do not apply to administrative proceedings, but such
language is certainly too broad. When an administrative agency is
acting in a judicial capacity and resolves 
[478 U.S. 798]
 disputed
issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an
adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to
apply res judicata to enforce repose." Id., at 421-422 (1966)
(footnotes omitted).
Thus, Utah Construction, which we subsequently
approved in Kremer v. Chemical Construction Co., 456
U. S., at 484-485, n. 26, teaches that giving preclusive
effect to administrative factfinding serves the value
underlying general principles of collateral estoppel:
enforcing repose.
6 
 This value, which encompasses both
the parties' interest in avoiding the cost and vexation of
repetitive litigation and the public's interest in
conserving judicial resources, Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.
S., at 94, is equally implicated whether factfinding is
done by a federal or state agency.
Having federal courts give preclusive effect to the
factfinding of state administrative tribunals also serves
the value of federalism. Significantly, all of the opinions
in Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261
(1980), express the view that the Full Faith and Credit
Clause compels the States to give preclusive effect to the
factfindings of an administrative tribunal in a sister
State. Id., at 281 (opinion of 
[478 U.S. 799]
 STEVENS,
J.); 287-289 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment); 291-
292 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). The Full Faith and
Credit Clause is of course not binding on federal courts,
but we can certainly look to the policies underlying the
Clause in fashioning federal common-law rules of
preclusion. "Perhaps the major purpose of the Full Faith
and Credit Clause is to act as a nationally unifying
force," id., at 289 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment),
and this purpose is served by giving preclusive effect to
state administrative factfinding rather than leaving the
courts of a second forum, state or federal, free to reach
conflicting results.
7 
 Accordingly, we hold that when a
state agency "acting in a judicial capacity . . . resolves
disputed issues of fact properly before it which the
parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,"
Utah Construction & Mining Co., supra, at 422, federal
courts must give the agency's factfinding the same
preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the
State's courts.
8
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in
part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
