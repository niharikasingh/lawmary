While this questionable rule[*] has been applied to various alleged regulatory takings, it was, in my view, rejected in the context of temporal deprivations of property by First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 318 (1987), which held that temporary and permanent takings "are not different in kind" when a landowner is deprived of all beneficial use of his land.
The Court assures them that "a temporary prohibition on economic use" cannot be a taking because "[l]ogically...the property will recover value as soon as the prohibition is lifted."
It is regrettable that the Court has charted a markedly different path today
