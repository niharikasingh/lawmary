Bell also appeals the district court's denial of her motion to amend her complaint.
Bell filed a motion to amend her original complaint on October 30, 1997, four working days after the court's motion cutoff deadline, seeking to add allegations that Allstate had illegally marketed the policies and that the policies violated Arkansas law by not including a conversion privilege.
The district court denied the motion to amend and granted summary judgment  in favor of the defendants on November 26, 1997.
II. A. Leave to Amend Complaint Bell argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion to amend her complaint.
See Dover Elevator Co. v. Arkansas State Univ., 64 F.3d 442, 448 (8th Cir.1995) (finding no abuse of discretion where trial was less than a month away, the discovery deadline was within a week of the motion to amend, and the amendment, adding a new theory of recovery, would leave the opposing party inadequate time to prepare); Vitale v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 814 F.2d 1242, 1252 (8th Cir.1987) (finding no abuse where the motion was made less than two months before trial, no reason was given for the delay, and the amendment may have required additional discovery on the new factual allegations).
We are unable to say on these facts that the district court abused its discretion in denying Bell's motion to amend her complaint.
B. Summary Judgment Bell appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment on her claims as originally filed, arguing that the alleged illegal activities of the defendants in relation to the insurance policies raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding her recovery under the policies.
III. For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court
