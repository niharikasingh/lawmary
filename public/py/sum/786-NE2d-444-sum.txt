Acknowledging that two of the other Appellate Division Departments had held that plaintiffs were entitled to discovery on demand,  the Court determined that the enactment of CPLR 3101 (i) did nothing to upset DiMichel's conclusion that surveillance tapes need not be produced until after a plaintiff is deposed.
These particular concerns led us to conclude that the plaintiffs in DiMichel had made the requisite showing under CPLR 3101 (d) (2) of substantial need and undue hardship, and were thus entitled to view the tapes before trial.
The question now before us is whether section 3101 (i) overrules that aspect of DiMichel which allows defendants to withhold surveillance tapes until after a plaintiff has been deposed.
Defendants contend that in enacting section 3101  N.Y.2d 388]  (i) the Legislature sought to expand the scope of discovery, but not to override DiMichel's timing rule.
Our holding in DiMichel—that once a plaintiff undergoes a deposition the defendant must turn over any surveillance tapes it intends to use at trial—rested heavily on the premise that surveillance tapes were subject to a qualified privilege under section 3101 (d) (2) (see DiMichel, 80 NY2d at 190).
In removing surveillance tapes from the reach of CPLR 3101 (d) (2), the Legislature eliminated the qualified privilege to which videotapes were previously subject.
We must assume that the Legislature was fully aware that the timing rule we announced in DiMichel was premised on surveillance tapes falling within section 3101 (d) (2) (see Hammelburger v Foursome Inn Corp., 54 N.Y.2d 580 ; McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes   191).
