The majority opinion further proclaims that public policy demands we enjoin the razing of this private residence in order to prevent land misuse in the City of St. Louis. But the City, like the beneficiaries, is not a party to this lawsuit.
The fact is the majority's holding is based upon wispy, self-proclaimed public policy grounds that were only vaguely pleaded, were not in evidence, and were only sketchily briefed by the plaintiffs.
In seeking to enjoin the removal of testatrix' home at # 4 Kingsbury Place, these plaintiffs claim they are entitled to an injunction first, by virtue of language in the trust indenture; secondly, because the razing would constitute a nuisance; and thirdly on the ground of public policy.
Except for one well-tended vacant lot (whose existence the majority  ignores in saying the street minus # 4 Kingsbury Place would be like "a missing front tooth") the trust indenture generally regulates size, constructions and cost of structures to be built on Kingsbury Place. It empowers the trustees to maintain vacant lots and to protect the street from "encroachment, trespass, nuisance and injury."
The court has resorted to public policy in order to vitiate Mrs. Johnston's valid testamentary direction.
The Asel court further cited as the definitive statement of public policy "the principle which declares that no one can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public welfare.
It requires judicial imagination to hold, as the majority does, that the mere presence of a second vacant lot on Kingsbury Place violates public policy.
Plaintiffs have not shown that such impairment will arise from the mere presence of another vacant lot on Kingsbury Place. I find no plain error in the trial court's denial of injunctive relief, and on the merits I would affirm the trial court's judgment.
Because of plaintiffs' defective brief, however, I would dismiss the appeal
