Section 501(b) of the 1976 Copyright Act establishes who is legally authorized to sue for infringement of a copyright: The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411, to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.
The right to sue for an accrued claim for infringement is not an exclusive right under § 106.
Section 201(d) refers to exclusive rights and provides: (1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.
Section 501(b) must also be read in conjunction with § 501(a), which provides that one who "violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 ... is an infringer."
In other words, Congress wanted to ensure that an owner of any exclusive right in the copyright was entitled to bring a suit for infringement.
17 U.S.C. § 101(b) (1952); Gardner v. Nike, Inc., 279 F.3d 774, 777-78 (9th Cir.2002). Courts interpreted the 1909 statute as providing a proprietor with an indivisible bundle of rights arising from a copyright — rights that could not be assigned piecemeal.
Id. ; see also H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 123, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5738-39 (noting that the right to assign separate property interests in a copyright had "long been sought by authors and their representatives" and had "attracted wide support from other groups").
If a right is not "specified," then it is not one of the exclusive rights granted by Congress. The House Report that deals with the exclusive rights provided in § 106 also explains that "[e]ach of the five enumerated rights may be subdivided indefinitely and, ... in connection with section 201 [governing transfer of rights], each subdivision of an exclusive right may be owned and enforced separately."
But only owners of an exclusive right in a copyright may sue.
Harris v. Emus Records Corp., 734 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1984) (quoting Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417, 439, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984)); see also Gardner, 279 F.3d at 780-81 (relying in part on patent law to hold that rights under an exclusive copyright license could not be assigned without the original licensor's consent and holding that assignee lacked standing to sue).
Like the 1976 Copyright Act, the Patent Act that was in force at the time the Supreme Court decided Crown Die did not explicitly forbid the assignment of bare causes of action for infringement: Every patent or any interest therein shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing, and the patentee or his assigns or legal representatives may in like manner grant and convey an exclusive right under his patent to the whole or any specified part of the United States. Pub.L. No. 147, § 6, 42 Stat. 389, 391 (1922) (amending R.S. § 4849).
We should interpret the Copyright Act consistently with the requirement of the Patent Act. Despite the differences between patents and copyrights, and between the statutes governing them, the common question is whether a substantive, exclusive right to intellectual property may be divorced from a cause of action for infringement of that substantive right.
The predecessor to the 1976 Act, the 1909 Act, simply afforded the "proprietor" of a copyright the right to sue for infringement.
The 1909 Act did not define "proprietor" or "exclusive rights," nor did it provide that "legal or beneficial owners" of exclusive rights were entitled to sue for infringement.
The Second Circuit came to a different conclusion under the 1976 Copyright Act. In Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., 697 F.2d 27 (2d Cir.1982), superseded by rule and statute on other grounds, the court held that one who owns no exclusive right in a copyright may not sue for infringement.
Whether the assignment was prospective or retrospective, however, the court made plain the basic principle, which we also have derived from § 501(b) and its context and history, that only the owner of an exclusive right under the copyright is entitled to sue for infringement.
Because that is all Frank & Bob Films conveyed to Silvers, Silvers was not entitled to institute and may not maintain this action against Sony for alleged infringement of the copyright in "The Other Woman." REVERSE
