It seems to me that when a large corporation is purchasing a smaller one, the fate of the employees of the selling corporation will naturally be a matter of concern to its management.
It was a matter of concern here, expressed in the exception taken with respect to the "lower level executive personnel."
I do not find that agreement was ever reached as to that matter.
Nor was agreement ever reached as to the employment and compensation of Conroy by the purchasing corporation.
For these reasons I think that no contract existed and that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed
