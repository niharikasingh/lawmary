This action involves a dispute arising from an alleged breach of a commercial ground lease, dated August 15, 1991, between the landlord plaintiffs Gotlieb and Blaymore, and tenant defendant Taco Bell Corporation ("Taco Bell"). District Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and referred this matter to the undersigned for a trial on damages.
The lease provided that the defendant was required to exercise diligence to obtain the necessary permits and administrative approvals to construct and operate the Taco Bell restaurant on the premises.
Also on February 14, 1992, defendant served on plaintiffs a written repudiation of the lease pursuant to Lease paragraph 6.
The defendant herein repudiated the lease by letter dated February 14, 1992, (Exhibit D to Complaint), sent in response to plaintiff's letter dated February 14, 1994 (Exhibit C to Complaint). Plaintiff's letter rejected defendant's February 10, 1992 request to alter the terms of the lease (Exhibit B to Complaint). The plaintiffs' February 14, 1992 letter explicitly stated that they would reject any attempt by the defendant to repudiate the lease and informed the defendant that they would be held liable under the terms of the lease.
(Exhibit C to Complaint.) The extent of plaintiffs' entitlement to damages therefore turns upon whether the surrender and repudiation of the lease was accepted, notwithstanding the assertions made in plaintiffs' February 14, 1992 letter.
See e.g., Gray, 162 N.Y. 388, 56 N.E. at 904 (court found acceptance by operation of law where plaintiff refused defendant's offer of surrender yet re-rented in his own name); Tootle Theater, 175 A.D. 530, 162 N.Y.S. at 113 ("The fact that plaintiff refused to accept surrender ... does not establish conclusively the absence of acceptance ... [it may be] implied from all the circumstances of the case").
The arguments before Judge Spatt on the motion for summary judgement pertained only to whether the plaintiffs were required to accept the defendant's repudiation under the lease terms.
Nevertheless, the testimony of plaintiff David Gotlieb at the damages trial revealed that despite the plaintiffs' rejection of the defendant's repudiation and surrender, the plaintiffs negotiated and made a written offer to lease the premises for their sole benefit to a prospective new tenant, Rite-Aid drug stores.
The Court finds that as a result of their affirmative conduct, the plaintiffs accepted the defendant's repudiation and surrender of the lease by operation of law between the October 19, 1993, meeting and the November 3, 1993 letter sent to the prospective tenant's agent.
The Court acknowledges that paragraph 62 of the lease contains a boilerplate provision which addresses acceptance of a surrender.
The defendant repudiated the lease on February 14, 1992, and therefore never made any rent payments.
Based upon the finding that the plaintiffs' implied acceptance of the surrender took place as of November, 1993, and that the lease remained in effect until that time, the defendants are liable for all rent due under the lease up to November, 1993.
The plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of establishing the relevance of this service to the prosecution of the instant action or to the lease paragraph which provides for additional rent. 2.
This Court finds there is no entitlement to rent beyond October, 1993, because the plaintiffs accepted the defendant's repudiation and surrender of the lease.
The only lease provision which might be considered an acceleration clause is paragraph 60(c), which provides in pertinent part:     Tenant ... shall also pay Landlord as liquidated damages for the failure of Tenant to observe and perform said Tenant's covenants herein contained, any deficiency between the rent hereby and/or covenanted to be paid and the net amount, if any, of the rents collected on account of the Lease or leases of the Demised Premises for each month of the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term of this Lease.... Any such liquidated damages shall be paid in monthly installments by Tenant on the rent day specified in this lease and any suit brought to collect the amount of the deficiency for any month shall not prejudice in any way the rights of Landlord to collect the deficiency of any subsequent month by a similar proceeding.
See Centurion Development, 60 A.D.2d 96, 400 N.Y.S.2d at 266 (finding tenant liable for rent only up to date where surrender accepted by operation of law); Benderson v. Poss, 142 A.D.2d 937, 530 N.Y.S.2d 362, 363 (1988) (limiting landlord's liquidated damage recovery to unpaid charges accrued up to landlord's termination of lease).
The defendant covenanted to construct a restaurant building on the leased premises pursuant to Lease paragraph 54.
Id. The Court finds that the plaintiffs are "prevailing parties" as provided under the lease provisions.
The plaintiffs prevailed in recouping damages with respect to this period of time because the Court has found that the plaintiffs are entitled to all accrued rent while the lease was in effect.
Lease covenants providing for attorney's fees and costs for an action under a lease are valid and not contrary to public policy as long as they are reasonable and not intended as a penalty or forfeiture. 379 Madison Ave. v. Stuyvesant Co., 242 A.D. 567, 275 N.Y.S. 953, 956 (1934), aff'd, 268 N.Y. 576, 198 N.E. 412 (1935); see also, Livigne v. D'Agostino Supermarkets, Inc., 616 N.Y.S.2d 515, 516 (App.Div.1994) (mem.

The Court has deciphered vague and cryptic billing entries presented as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2.
