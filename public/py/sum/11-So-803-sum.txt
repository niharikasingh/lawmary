The plaintiff, W. D. Carroll, is, and was at the time of entering into the service of the defendant, the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, and at the time of being injured in that service, a citizen of Alabama. The defendant is an Alabama corporation, operating a railroad extending from Chattanooga, in the state of Tennessee, through Alabama to Meridian, in the state of Mississippi. At the time of the casualty complained of plaintiff was in the service of the defendant in the capacity of brakeman on freight trains running from Birmingham, Ala., to Meridian, Miss., under a contract which was made in the state of Alabama. The injury was caused by the breaking of a link between two cars in a freight train which was proceeding from Birmingham to Meridian. The point at which the link broke and the injury was suffered was in the state of Mississippi. The evidence tended to show that the link which broke was a defective link, and that it was in a defective condition when the train left Birmingham. The evidence went also to show that the defect in this link consisted in or resulted from its having been bent while cold; that this tended to weaken the iron, and in this instance had cracked the link somewhat on the outer curve of the bend, and that the link broke at the point of this crack.
The foregoing statement of facts, either proved or finding lodgment in the tendencies of the evidence, together with the evidence of the law of Mississippi as to the master's liability for injuries sustained by an employee in his service, will suffice for the consideration and determination of the question which is of chief importance in this case, namely, whether the defendant is liable at all, on the facts presented by this record, for an injury sustained by the plaintiff in the state of Mississippi. The only negligence which finds support in any tendency of the evidence, is that of persons whose duty it was to inspect the links of the train, and remove such as were defective, and replace them with others which were not defective.
The fact which created the right to sue,-the injury,-without which confessedly no action would lie anywhere, transpired in the state of Mississippi. It was in that state, therefore, necessarily that the cause of action, if any, arose; and whether a cause of action arose and existed at all, or not, must in all reason be determined by the law which obtained at the time and place when and where the fact which is relied on to justify a recovery transpired.
For the error in refusing to instruct the jury to find for the defendant, if they believed the evidence, the judgment is reversed, and the cause will be remanded
