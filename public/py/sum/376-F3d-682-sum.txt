Pursuant to Colorado River, the district court stayed this action in favor of the state proceeding.
On behalf of Sears, the Brewster complaint alleges that certain officers and directors of Sears breached their fiduciary duties under New York state law in connection with Sears' decision to enter the competitive MasterCard market.
Also premised on New York law, the Clark complaint alleges that officers and/or directors of Sears breached their fiduciary duties with respect to Sears' MasterCard operations and seeks damages and equitable relief on behalf of Sears. The Clark complaint names four defendants not named in the Brewster lawsuit and states three additional causes of action â€” abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.
Additionally, the Clark defendants filed a motion in the district court to stay this action pursuant to the doctrine set forth in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), or in the alternative to dismiss.
Using the Colorado River factors, the district court determined that a stay was warranted in this case because it would promote judicial administration.
(citing Lumen Constr., Inc. v. Brant Constr. Co., 780 F.2d 691, 694-95 (7th Cir.1985)). A. Parallel Actions Clark contends that the district court abused its discretion by finding that the Brewster and Clark actions are parallel.
Id. After reviewing the two complaints, we agree with the district court that no meaningful distinction can be made between the Clark and Brewster lawsuits.
Their inclusion in the federal proceeding does not alter the case's central issue (the same one presented by the Brewster action), i.e., whether Sears officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to Sears in connection with Sears' entry into the MasterCard market.
Not only would a stay save judicial resources, but it would also protect against the danger of the two proceedings reaching inconsistent results, especially in light of the recent dismissal of Brewster by the New York Supreme Court. Next, we agree with the district court's determination that because both cases are    governed by New York law, it is better to defer to the New York courts to consider the issues presented.
The Brewster action will continue in New York regardless of whether the Clark action is stayed in Illinois. Moreover, the thrust of Clark's argument regarding convenience of the Illinois forum (as well as her arguments relating to other factors) is that the district court assigned this factor insufficient weight in the its analysis.
Accordingly, since the state and federal proceedings at issue are parallel and a stay would promote wise judicial administration, we decline to hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the exceptional nature of this case justified a stay.
Moreover, a stay is a measured approach that protects the substantial rights of the parties and allows Clark the possibility of continuing this litigation once the Brewster action reaches a conclusion in New York.   III. Conclusion We AFFIRM the district court's stay order 
The district court appropriately addressed the Colorado River factors, applying more significant analysis to those factors most relevant in this case.
