Plaintiffs-appellants Sebastian and Maria Shaumyan ("the Shaumyans") brought this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action as a class action on behalf of themselves and others against defendant-appellee Sidetex Company, Inc. ("Sidetex") and its attorney, defendant-appellee Steven Rolnick. In their complaint,  the Shaumyans alleged that the defendants deprived them of their property rights without due process by attaching their home pursuant to Connecticut's prejudgment attachment statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 52-278e(a)(1) (1991).
See Shaumyan v. O'Neill, 716 F.Supp. 65 (D.Conn.1989) ("Shaumyan I"). In a subsequent opinion, the district court reconsidered its prior decision in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Connecticut v. Doehr, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), and reaffirmed its earlier holding that Connecticut's statute was constitutional as applied to the case before it.
On appeal, we remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's opinion in Connecticut v. Doehr, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), affirming our decision in Pinsky v. Duncan, 898 F.2d 852 (2d Cir.1990), that Connecticut's prejudgment attachment statute was unconstitutional as applied to intentional tortfeasors.
In Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969), the Supreme Court held that a Wisconsin statute permitting the prejudgment garnishment of a debtor's wages without prior notice or a hearing violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court took care to note that the statute allowed a court clerk rather than a judge to garnish a defendant's wages at the request of the creditor's attorney, id. at 338, 89 S.Ct. at 1821, and noted further that wages were "a specialized type of property presenting distinct problems in our economic system," id. at 340, 89 S.Ct. at 1822.
In Spielman-Fond, a three-judge court declined to strike down Arizona's mechanic's lien statute on due process grounds even though the statute did not have the procedural safeguards that were present in Mitchell. The district court upheld the statute because it did not consider the encumbrance placed on the real property by the mechanic's lien to be a "taking of a significant property interest." 379 F.Supp. at 999.
The Doehr Court applied the three-prong test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), to determine whether Connecticut's prejudgment attachment statute violated the Due Process Clause. First, the court must consider the private interests that will be affected by the prejudgment measure.
Id. In applying the third prong of its test, the Doehr Court found that the plaintiff had no existing interest in the defendant's real property  when he sought the attachment.
Five members of the Doehr Court declined to address the issue of whether the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1) to require that a plaintiff post a security bond violated the Due Process Clause. A plurality of four Justices, however, reached this issue and stated that due process required a plaintiff to post a security bond to obtain a prejudgment attachment.
Rather, as in Doehr, we will determine whether the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the Shaumyans. See Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2109 ("We hold that, as applied to this case, [section 52-278e(a)(1)] does not [satisfy the Due Process Clause].") (emphasis added).
Thus, because the procedural safeguards of section 52-278e(a)(1) satisfy the second  and third prongs of the Doehr test as it is applied to the Shaumyans, we hold that it does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. B. The Shaumyans also argue that section 52-278e(a)(1) is unconstitutional because it does not require a plaintiff to post a security bond.
In Pinsky, the concurring and dissenting judges agreed that the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1) to require the plaintiff to post a security bond was not constitutionally defective because a defendant whose property had been wrongfully attached could bring a counterclaim for damages under Connecticut's vexatious litigation statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 52-568(a) (1991), instead of having to initiate a new action.
Thus, although the standard of liability articulated by the DeLaurentis court apparently would limit the number of debtors who could bring vexatious litigation suits against creditors who attached their real property pursuant to section 52-278e(a)(1), plaintiffs like the Shaumyans may still utilize Connecticut's vexatious litigation statute to protect their interests in the absence of a security bond.
See Doehr, ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2122 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) ("To require any sort of a contested court hearing or bond before the notice of [a mechanic's] lien takes effect would largely defeat the purpose of these statutes.").
Therefore, we hold that the failure of section 52-278e(a)(1) to require Sidetex to post a security bond does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. CONCLUSION In upholding the constitutionality of section 52278e(a)(1) against the challenges brought by the Shaumyans, Judge Nevas wrote in his second opinion that his decision was "limited exclusively to the facts of this case and its application to a breach of contract action involving an attachment of real property in which the attaching plaintiff seeks payment for material installed and labor performed on that piece of real property."
We agree, and affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects
