Appellant argues that the district court should, somehow, have set aside the finding that the appellant made the ladder.
See Deposit Guaranty National Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. at 332-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1170-71  (allowing plaintiffs who received judgment in their favor to appeal denial of class action certification — a separate judicial holding that directly affected their "economic interest"); Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U.S. 241, 59 S.Ct. 860, 83 L.Ed. 1263 (1939) (allowing victorious defendants in patent infringement suit to appeal to eliminate from the decree the finding that the patent, though not infringed, was valid — a finding with direct and significant impact on the appellant).
