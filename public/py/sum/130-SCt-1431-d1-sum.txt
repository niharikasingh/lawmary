The Court nevertheless holds that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures for the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts the application of § 901(b) in diversity suits.
Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 37-38, 108 S.Ct. 2239, 101 L.Ed.2d 22 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("[I]n deciding whether a federal ... Rule of Procedure encompasses a particular issue, a broad reading that would create significant disuniformity between state and federal courts should be avoided if the text permits.").
In Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), for example, the Court read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative defenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed defenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in such cases, Palmer held, state law controls.
In Walker, the Court took up the question whether Ragan should be overruled; we held, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly conflict with state rules governing the time when an action commences for purposes of tolling a limitations period. 446 U.S. at 749-752, 100 S.Ct. 1978.
We held that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involuntary dismissal "operate[d] as an adjudication on the merits," did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in Maryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Maryland courts from entertaining the case, we said, "would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act," 531 U.S. at 503, 121 S.Ct. 1021, and "would in many cases violate [Erie's] federalism principle," id. at 504, 121 S.Ct. 1021.
In sum, both before and after Hanna, the abovedescribed decisions show, federal courts have been cautioned by this Court to "interpre[t] the Federal Rules... with sensitivity to important state interests," Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, and a will "to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies," id. at 438, n. 22, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court  veers away from that approach—and conspicuously, its most recent reiteration in Gasperini, ante at 1441, n. 7—in favor of a mechanical reading of Federal Rules, insensitive to state interests and productive of discord.
New York's decision instead to block class-action proceedings for statutory damages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means to a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant's liability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbitant inflation of penalties—remedies the New York Legislature created with individual suits in mind. D Shady Grove contends—and the Court today agrees—that Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York's prohibition on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions.
Section 901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does not allow class members to recover statutory damages because the New York Legislature considered the result of adjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant. The fair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legitimate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of state law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State's lawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers.
Under the Court's reasoning—which attributes dispositive significance to the words "may not be maintained"—Rule 23 would preempt this provision, nevermind that Congress, by authorizing the promulgation of rules of procedure for federal courts, surely did not intend to displace state-created ceilings on damages. The Court suggests  that the analysis might differ if the statute "limit[ed] the remedies available in an existing class action," ante at 1439, such that Rule 23 might not conflict with a state statute prescribing that "no more than $1,000,000 may be recovered in a class action."
Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves § 901(b) in control of the remedial issue at the core of this case should be dispelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions against stretching a rule to cover every situation it could conceivably reach. The Court states that "[t]here is no reason ... to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether claims made eligible for class treatment by some other law should be certified as class actions."
States may hesitate to create determinate statutory penalties in the future if they are impotent to prevent federal-court distortion of the remedy they have shaped. By finding a conflict without considering whether Rule 23 rationally should be read to avoid any collision, the Court unwisely and unnecessarily retreats from the federalism principles undergirding Erie. Had the Court reflected on the respect for state regulatory interests endorsed in our decisions, it would have found no cause to interpret Rule 23 so woodenly—and every  reason not to do so.
Shady Grove also ranks § 901(b) as "procedural" because "nothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to rights of action based on New York state law, as opposed to federal law or the law of other states"; instead it "applies to actions seeking penalties under any statute."
See also ante at 1457-1458 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Section 901(b) cannot "be understood as a rule that... serves the function of defining New York's rights or remedies" because its "text ... expressly and unambiguously applies not only to claims based on New York law but also to claims based on federal law or the law of any other State."). It is true that § 901(b) is not specifically limited to claims arising under New York law.
Shady Grove's suggestion that States must specifically limit their laws to domestic rights of action if they wish their enactments to apply in federal diversity litigation misses the obvious point: State legislators generally do not focus on an interstate setting when drafting statutes. Shady Grove also observes that a New York court has applied § 901(b) to a federal claim for relief under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227, see Rudgayzer & Gratt v. Cape Canaveral Tour & Travel, Inc., 22 App. Div.3d 148, 799 N.Y.S.2d 795 (2005), thus revealing § 901(b)'s "procedural" cast.
The TCPA, the Supreme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus "carves out an exception to th[e] general rule" that "when Erie ... is reversed ..., a state court hearing a federal case is normally required to apply federal substantive law": "Under § 227(b)(3) ... it is state substantive law that determines, as a preliminary matter, whether a federal action under the act may be brought in state court."
They supply "substantive" law in diversity suits, see York, 326 U.S. at 109-112, 65 S.Ct. 1464, even though, as Shady Grove acknowledges, state courts often apply the forum's limitations period as a "procedural" bar to claims arising under the law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17.
Similarly, federal courts sitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the burden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), yet state courts adjudicating foreign causes of action often apply their own local law to this issue.
See Restatement § 133 and Reporter's Note. In short, Shady Grove's effort to characterize § 901(b) as simply "procedural" cannot successfully elide this fundamental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of an issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the sense our cases on Erie (pre and postHanna) develop, the Rules of Decision Act commands application of the State's law in diversity suits.
As this case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award statutory penalties in class actions while New York courts are bound by § 901(b)'s proscription, "substantial variations between state and federal [money judgments] may be expected."
See Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 431, 116 S.Ct. 2211 ("Erie precludes a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court.
See also id. at 439-440, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) ("A state-law ceiling on allowable damages ... is a substantive rule of decision that federal courts must apply in diversity cases governed by New York law.
See Woods, 337 U.S. at 538, 69 S.Ct. 1235 (in a diversity case, a plaintiff "barred from recovery in the state court ... should likewise be barred in the federal court"); York, 326 U.S. at 108-109, 65 S.Ct. 1464 (federal court sitting in diversity "cannot afford recovery if the right to recover is made unavailable by the State nor can it substantively affect the enforcement of the right as given by the State"). Just as Erie precludes a federal court from entering a deficiency judgment when a State has "authoritatively announced that [such] judgments cannot be secured within its borders," Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183, 191, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947), so too Erie should prevent a federal court from awarding statutory penalties aggregated through a class action when New York prohibits this recovery.
I would therefore hold that the New York Legislature's limitation on the recovery of statutory damages applies in this case, and would affirm the Second Circuit's judgment
