Rogers-Olympic also manufactures castings for armored vehicles, and these castings are sold to the United States Army.
The issue presented on this appeal is whether Rogers-Olympic had sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Louisiana for purposes of personal jurisdiction under the Louisiana Long-Arm Statute and the Due Process Clause.
The cylinders, with the Rogers-Olympic steel castings incorporated into them, were eventually used in the dredge constructed by Avondale for Bean's use in Louisiana.
The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State.

In Oswalt v. Scripto, Inc., 616 F.2d 191 (5th Cir.1980), the court noted that the manufacturer delivered millions of lighters to the distributor with the understanding that the distributor would sell the lighters to a customer with national retail outlets.
Rogers-Olympic seeks to distinguish Oswalt v. Scripto on the basis of numbers and argues: "In the instant case, Rogers-Olympic manufactured and sold to Remco two steel castings which were delivered either in the State of Washington or California, with ... no indication whatsoever as to their ultimate destination."
Instead, just as we considered the millions of lighters in Oswalt, we must consider the thousands of steel castings produced by Rogers-Olympic and incorporated as component parts of products sold throughout the nation.
Whereas in Oswalt v. Scripto the manufacturer introduced millions of lighters into the stream of commerce, in the instant case Rogers-Olympic introduced thousands of steel castings into that stream.
As in Oswalt v. Scripto, the manufacturer here evidenced no attempt to limit the states in which its castings would be sold and used, albeit as a component part of a larger product.
See Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 22 Ill.2d 432; 176 N.E.2d 761 (1961) (holding the manufacturer of a defective valve used in a water heater amenable to jurisdiction as a nonresident defendant), cited with approval in Oswalt v. Scripto, 615 F.2d at 201-02.
The Fairness of the Louisiana Forum The second question to be determined under due process analysis is whether it would be "fair" to require Rogers-Olympic to defend this suit in Louisiana.
