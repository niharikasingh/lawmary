The Court faithfully applies our precedents interpreting 28 U. S. C. ยง 1331 to authorize federal-court jurisdiction over some cases in which state law creates the cause of action but requires determination of an issue of federal law, e. g., Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180 (1921); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804 (1986).
In this case, no one has asked us to overrule those precedents and adopt the rule Justice Holmes set forth in American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257 (1916), limiting ยง 1331 jurisdiction to cases in which federal law creates the cause of action pleaded on the face of the plaintiff's complaint.
Accordingly, I would be willing in appropriate circumstances to reconsider our interpretation of ยง 1331
