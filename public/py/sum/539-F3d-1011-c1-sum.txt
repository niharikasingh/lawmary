Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 807 (9th Cir.2004). A defendant "purposefully avails" himself of a forum when he acts in a way that creates a "substantial connection" with the state, Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, see also Kulko v. California Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84, 94, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978), as where he deliberately engages in significant activities there, Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984), or creates "continuing obligations" between himself and its residents.
Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1157-58; Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d at 419-20. The defendant must do "something more" to aim activity expressly at a state, Cybersell, 130 F.3d at 418, 419; Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1156-57, and  Boschetto has not shown either that Hansing tailored his auction to the residents of any state in particular, or that he sent or advertised his auction to any state in particular, much less California. Arguably, Hansing could foresee that California residents would bid on his auction, and that he would benefit from their participation, but foreseeable participation by Californians is not enough.
Hansing must have done something more to aim his auction expressly at the state, such as individually targeting California residents. Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1157.
He simply permitted those with eBay access throughout the United States and Canada to bid on his car, agreeing to let the winner retrieve it in Janesville, Wisconsin. Accordingly, although Hansing listed his car for sale in an unrestricted eBay auction, allowing residents of all states to view the auction and bid, and though he ultimately sold the car to a California resident, he neither availed himself of the privilege of doing business in California nor purposefully directed any activity at the state. I agree that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Boschetto jurisdictional discovery.
Where, as here, a plaintiff's claim of personal jurisdiction is both attenuated and based on bare allegations rebutted by specific denials made by the defendants, the district court need not permit even limited discovery
