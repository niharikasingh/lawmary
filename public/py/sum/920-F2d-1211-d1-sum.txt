I concur in the majority opinion, except to note that Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 98 S.Ct.
2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978) does not entirely resolve the issue of the applicability of Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545, 109 S.Ct.
In speaking with approval of ancillary jurisdiction in cases of third party actions, Owen was referring to impleader under Rule 14.
Finley should not be read so broadly as to upset a flexible approach to ancillary jurisdiction in a case such as the one at hand
