The City of Macon, Georgia ("Macon") appeals a declaratory judgment granted to Alltel Communications, Inc. ("Alltel") and a permanent injunction imposed against Macon. In deciding the ultimate issues of this case, we must first determine whether the district court properly interpreted and applied Georgia law.
In July 1997, Alltel contracted with Georgia Power Company for the purpose of installing fiber optic cable on utility poles owned and maintained by Georgia Power along city streets within Macon. Pursuant to the existing municipal ordinance, Alltel sought and obtained a permit from Macon on July 4, 1997, authorizing placement of the fiber optic cable.
None of the cable was installed upon the rights-of-way which are under the direct authority of the Georgia Department of Transportation. From July 1997 through April 11, 2000, the City charged a $2.00 per linear foot annual permit fee under Section 18-153 of Article VII, Chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances for Macon. Alltel paid the fees without objection.
The purpose of the ordinance is to "... govern the compensation charged by the City in its franchising and licensing of telecommunications providers and in the City's management of the use of the public  right-of-way within the corporate limits and boundaries of the City." On July 8, 1999, Macon amended the ordinance, increasing the permit fee from $2.00 to $4. per linear foot ("the Amended Ordinance"). On April 11, 2000, Macon submitted an invoice to Alltel for $114,997. for one-year fees under the Amended Ordinance. Alltel has refused to pay this amount, contending that Macon cannot charge $4. per foot but rather is limited to $5,000 per mile ($0.947 per foot), the rate charged by the Georgia Department of Transportation on its rightsof-way.
On September 27, 2002, the district court entered an order granting Alltel's motion and concluding that under Georgia Code ยง 32-4-92(a)(10), Macon's Amended Ordinance was invalid because it is "preempted by state law" and charges a rate that exceeds that charged by the Georgia Department of Transportation (D.O.T.).
The D.O.T. did not intend for its 1985 fee schedule to limit or affect municipal fees, and if Alltel's interpretation is correct, the regulation is an invalid delegation of legislative power.
In DeKalb County v. Georgia Power Co., 249 Ga. 704, 292 S.E.2d 709 (1982), the court, interpreting ยง 32-4-42(6), stated: DeKalb County is not entitled to extract from the power company a tax, franchise fee, rental fee, or other charge (however designated) in return for permission to use the county's road rights-of-way outside of municipalities for the erection, maintenance and use of power transmission lines.
Section 36-34-2(7) states that municipalities have the power to "grant franchises to or make contracts with ... electric light or power companies, gas companies, steam-heat companies, telephone and telegraph companies, water companies, and other public utilities for the use and occupancy of the streets of the city...." Although not directly on point, numerous cases have up-held a municipality's right to charge a franchise fee, specifically under this statute.
Because a municipal ordinance cannot supersede an act of the legislature, see City of Atlanta v. Myers, 240 Ga. 261, 240 S.E.2d 60, 63 (1977), the district court properly enjoined enforcement of the Amended Ordinance. The fees at issue are clearly permit fees, not franchise fees.
Because the fees are permit fees, DeKalb County v. Georgia Power Co., 249 Ga. 704, 292 S.E.2d 709 (1982), cited by Macon, would actually support Alltel's position, i.e., that Macon cannot charge any fees at all unless authorized by statute, and the statute places limits on what can be charged.
Conclusion The district court concluded, which the parties have not disputed, that there is no Georgia case law or legislative history which addresses whether fees of the type charged by Macon are limited by ยง 32-4-92(a)(10) or other Georgia statutes or regulations.
To assist that Court's consideration of the case, the entire record, along with the briefs of the parties, shall be transmitted to the Supreme Court of Georgia. QUESTION CERTIFIED
