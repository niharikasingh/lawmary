I believe the entire habendum clause which purports to restrict the fee simple conveyed is invalid as a restraint upon alienation within the ambit of Civil Code, section 711.
In the first place, a restriction upon the kind of use does not restrain alienation because the property may be conveyed to anyone, subject to the restriction.
It also appears that there is some correlation between a restriction upon who may use property, and the exclusion of a racial group from the use of property prohibited by Civil Code section 782.
It has the effect, however, of curtailing alienability and the validity of such a provision is determined by the same considerations as are stated in Comment l. The applicable rule is analogous to the rule stated in this Section." The usual restriction in violation of section 782 specifically excludes Negroes, orientals, or other ethnic groups from using property.
I would hold the property free from restrictions, and reverse the judgment
