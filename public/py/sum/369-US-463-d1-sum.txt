The notion that a District Court may deal with an in personam action in such a way as possibly to affect a defendant's substantive rights without first acquiring jurisdiction over him is not a familiar one in federal  jurisprudence.
No one suggests that Congress was aware that 28 U. S. C. ยง 1406 (a) might be so used when it enacted that statute.
The "interest of justice" of which the statute speaks and which the Court's opinion emphasizes in support of its construction of ยง 1406 (a) is assuredly not a one-way street.
And it is incongruous to consider, as the Court's holding would seem to imply, that in the "interest of justice" Congress sought in ยง 1406 (a) to deal with the transfer of cases where both venue and jurisdiction are lacking in the district where the action is commenced, while neglecting to provide any comparable alleviative measures for the plaintiff who selects a district where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained.
* In these circumstances I think the matter is better left for further action by Congress, preferably after the Judicial Conference of the United States has expressed its views on the subject.
