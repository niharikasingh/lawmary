Plaintiff contends that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply because the defendant who is asserting the plea was not a party to the previous action nor in privity with a party to that action and because there is no mutuality of estoppel.
II] The doctrine of res judicata precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a cause of action that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

*) The criteria for determining who may assert a plea of res judicata differ fundamentally[19 Cal.
The requirements of due process of law forbid the assertion of a plea of res judicata against a party unless he was bound by the earlier litigation in which the matter was decided.
There is no compelling reason, however, for requiring that the party asserting the plea of res judicata must have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the earlier litigation.
Many courts have abandoned the requirement of mutuality and confined the requirement of privity to the party against whom the plea of res judicata is asserted.
a broad exception to the requirements of mutuality and privity, namely, that they are not necessary where the liability of the defendant asserting the plea of res judicata • is dependent upon or derived from the liability of one who was exonerated in an earlier suit brought by the same plaintiff upon the same facts.

each of these situations the party asserting the plea of res judicata was not a party to the previous action nor in privity with such a party under the accepted definition of a privy set forth above.
In determining the validity of a plea of res judicata three questions are pertinent: Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question I'Was there a final judgment on the merits?
In the present case, therefore, the defendant is not precluded by lack of privity or of mutuality of estoppel from, asserting the plea of res judicata against the plaintiff.
Since, the issue as to the ownership of the money is identical with the issue raised in the probate proceeding, and since the order of the probate court settling the executor’s account Was a final adjudication of this issue on the merits (Prob.
’ The plea of res judicata is therefore available against plaintiff as a party to the former proceeding, despite her formal change of capacity.
