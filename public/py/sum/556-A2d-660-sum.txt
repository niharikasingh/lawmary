Id. In this appeal Mrs. Sweeney disputes the amount of alimony and child support awarded by the Superior Court upon remand and contends that it was improper for the court to allow Dr. Sweeney to offset his obligation to pay private school expenses for the child with income taxable to the child from assets held by Mrs. Sweeney's parents.
We find no abuse of discretion in the court's award of alimony and its determination of child support, but we do *661 find that the court impermissibly set off Dr. Sweeney's obligation to pay the child's private school expenses.
The amended divorce judgment, however, provided in relevant part: to the extent that assets are held by [the child's] maternal grandparents or any third party for [the child's] benefit, the income from which is taxable to [the child], then the income from such assets may be set off against the Waynflete School expenses on the request of Dr. Sweeney. The amended divorce judgment, while not requiring that the child attend Waynflete, directs Dr. Sweeney to pay any Waynflete expenses, subject to the set-off provision, in the event that the child continues to attend Waynflete. Assuming without deciding that there might be circumstances under which it would be appropriate for a divorce court to consider the personal income of a child when imposing a child support obligation upon a parent, the court in this case erred *662 in allowing Dr. Sweeney's obligation to pay private school expenses to be offset with income taxed to the child of this marriage.
The entry is: Amended Divorce Judgment modified to strike that portion of the judgment relating to the set off of Dr. Sweeney's private school expense obligation, and, as modified, judgment affirmed
