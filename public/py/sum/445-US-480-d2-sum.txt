v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976), and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), and in cases concerning the cessation of challenged conduct during the pendency of litigation, see, e. g., Walling v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc., 323 U.S. 37, 43 (1944).
3   The Court's cases lay down no mechanistic test for determining whether a dispute is ripe for adjudication.
The Court has observed that "[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy," O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 (1974), and that "general assertions or inferences" that illegal conduct will recur do not render a case ripe.
4   They have not expressed a present intent or desire to transfer appellee to a mental facility pursuant to the challenged provisions.
It is for these reasons that I would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to that court with directions to dismiss the complaint.
