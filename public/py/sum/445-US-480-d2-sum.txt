At most, although I think otherwise, it is a case presenting a "mixed question" of ripeness and mootness, hinging on the possibility that the challenged procedures will be applied again to appellee.
2   Certainly it is not the result of any effort on the part of the appellants to avoid review by this Court. Thus, since these mixed mootness/ ripeness rules are inapplicable, this case presents for me nothing more than a plain, old-fashioned question of ripeness. 3   The Court's cases lay down no mechanistic test for determining whether a dispute is ripe for adjudication.
The Court has observed that "[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy," O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 (1974), and that "general assertions or inferences" that illegal conduct will recur do not render a case ripe.
Since our remand, the state officials have indicated nothing more than that they have a general right to apply their statute, and to apply it to appellee if necessary. 4   They have not expressed a present intent or desire to transfer appellee to a mental facility pursuant to the challenged provisions.
It is for these reasons that I would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to that court with directions to dismiss the complaint.
