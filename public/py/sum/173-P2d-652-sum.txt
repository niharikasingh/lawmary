The theory of the respondent was that the tort of conversion could be "waived" and suit brought in quasi contract, upon a contract implied in law, to recover, as restitution, the profits which inured to appellant as a result of its wrongful use of the machine.
. resulted in a benefit to the users, in that said use saves the users approximately $1. per hour of use as against the expense which would be incurred were eggs to be washed by hand; that said machine was used by Puget Sound Egg Packers and defendant, on an average of one day per week from May of 1941, until February of 1945 at an average saving of $10.00 per each day of use."
In substance, the argument presented by the assignments of error is that the principle of unjust enrichment, or quasi contract, is not of universal application but is imposed only in exceptional cases because of special facts and circumstances and in favor of particular persons; that respondent had an adequate remedy in an action at law for replevin or claim and delivery; that any damages awarded to the plaintiff should be based upon the use or rental value of the machine and should bear some reasonable relation to its market value.
 It is clear that the saving in labor cost which appellant derived from its use of respondent's machine constituted a benefit.
 It is also necessary to show that, while appellant benefited from its use of the egg-washing machine, respondent thereby incurred a loss.
It is argued by appellant that, since the machine was put into storage by respondent, who had no present use for it, and for a period of almost three years did not know that appellant was operating it, and since it was not injured by its operation and the appellant never adversely claimed any title to it, nor contested respondent's right of repossession upon the latter's discovery of the wrongful operation, that the respondent was not damaged, because he is as well off as if the machine had not been used by appellant.
 Respondent has prayed "on his first cause of action for the sum of twenty-five dollars per month from the time defendant first commenced to use said machine subsequent to May 1940 (1941) until present time."
