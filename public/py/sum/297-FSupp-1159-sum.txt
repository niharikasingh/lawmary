But this, as will be seen, would permit some cases to be brought in federal court which could not be so brought absent the Declaratory Judgment Act. The alternative is to say that the declaratory action may be entertained in federal court only if the coercive action which would have been brought, absent declaratory judgment procedure, might have been so brought."
* * * To sanction suits for declaratory relief as within the jurisdiction of the District Courts merely because, as in this case, artful pleading anticipates a defense based on federal law would contravene the whole trend of jurisdictional legislation by Congress, disregard the effective functioning of the federal judicial system and distort the limited procedural purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act." 339 U.S. at 673-674, 70 S.Ct. at 880.
This court does not believe that Congress, in enacting the Declaratory Judgment Act, intended to permit a person to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts merely because he commenced a declaratory judgment action before the other party was able to commence his nonremovable coercive action in state court.
Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter should be sustained.
