I cannot accept the majority's attempted justification for the current law of prescriptive easements.
How, in today's urban society, litigation is reduced or the peace is preserved by allowing persons situated as are these plaintiffs to acquire rights in what is concededly the land of another without a cent of payment is beyond my comprehension.
I therefore agree entirely with the policy criticisms contained in Justice Reynoso's dissenting opinion.
I am persuaded, however, that if change is to come to this arcane area of the law it should come through the Legislature rather than through the courts.
