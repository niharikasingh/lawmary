As the Court points out, ante, at 319-320, petitioner's motion for summary judgment was based on the proposition that respondent could not prevail unless she proved that her deceased husband had been exposed to petitioner's products "within the jurisdictional limits" of the District of Columbia.  Respondent made an adequate showing — albeit possibly not in admissible form — that her husband had been exposed to petitioner's product in Illinois. Although the basis of the motion and the argument had been the lack of exposure in the District of Columbia, the District Court stated at the end of the argument: "The Court will grant the defendant Celotex's motion for summary judgment there being no showing that the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant Celotex's product in the District of Columbia or elsewhere within the statutory period."
App. 217 (emphasis added).
The District Court offered no additional explanation and no written opinion.
The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis that Celotex had not met its burden; the court noted the incongruity of the District Court's opinion in the context of the motion and argument, but did not rest on that basis because of the "or elsewhere" language. Taken in the context of the motion for summary judgment on the basis of no exposure in the District of Columbia, the  District Court's decision to grant summary judgment was palpably erroneous.
The court's bench reference to "or elsewhere" neither validated that decision nor raised the complex question addressed by this Court today.
In light of the District Court's plain error, therefore, it is perfectly clear that, even after this Court's abstract exercise in Rule construction, we should nonetheless affirm the reversal of summary judgment on that narrow ground. I respectfully dissent
