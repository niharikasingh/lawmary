The complaint further alleges that the plaintiff duly performed all the terms and conditions of the said agreement on her part to be performed, but that, although the defendant used the idea and recipe in its business, it has failed and refused to pay the plaintiff any compensation. 9 In her bill of particulars, which may properly be considered on this motion (Dineen v. May, 149 App.Div. 469, 134 N.Y.S. 7), the plaintiff stated that the agreement was contained in a letter addressed to an officer of the defendant to the effect that the plaintiff had an idea for a new food product and for the form of merchandising thereof by the defendant and the following letter received in reply from the defendant: 10 "General Foods Corporation "Postum Building, 250 Park Avenue "New York "Lewis W. Waters "Vice President "February 13th, 1934.
See Miller v. Schloss, 218 N.Y. 400, 113 N.E. 337. 13 Woodward, in section 65 of his work on Quasi Contracts, states that, where the form or character of the promise leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff did not rely upon it as a contractual obligation but trusted the fairness and liberality of the defendant, there is not only no contract but no misreliance upon a supposed contract, and consequently no legal obligation whatever. 14 This is my construction of the defendant's understanding "that the use to be made of it (the recipe) by us, and the compensation, if any, to be paid therefor, are matters resting solely in our discretion."
Also see McDonald v. Acker, Merrall & Condit Co., 192 App.Div. 123, 182 N.Y.S. 607, and other cases collected in 92 A.L.R. 1391. 15 Accordingly, I am obliged to grant the defendant's motion and to hold that the plaintiff in disclosing her recipe relied upon the good faith and sense of fairness of the defendant corporation to recompense her for the value of the recipe
