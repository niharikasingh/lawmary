Hooters responded that she was required to submit her claims to arbitration according to a binding agreement to arbitrate between the parties.
The agreement provides that Hooters and the employee each agree to arbitrate all disputes arising out of employment, including "any claim of discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, or wrongful discharge, whether arising under federal or state law."
In response, Hooters requested that the district court stay the proceedings on the counterclaims until after arbitration, 9 U.S.C. In March 1998, the district court denied Hooters' motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings on the counterclaims.
The court found that there was no meeting of the minds on all of the material terms of the agreement and even if there were, Hooters' promise to arbitrate was illusory.
In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., the Court noted that "`[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.'" 500 U.S. at 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (alteration in original) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U.S. at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346).
Id. The EEOC argues that in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, Congress evinced an intent to prohibit predispute agreements to arbitrate claims arising under Title VII. This circuit, however, has already rejected this argument.
The question remains whether a binding arbitration agreement between Phillips and Hooters exists and compels Phillips to submit her Title VII claims to arbitration.
Glass v. Kidder Peabody & Co., 114 F.3d 446, 453 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting Paine-Webber Inc. v. Hartmann, 921 F.2d 507, 511 (3d Cir.1990)). Hooters argues that Phillips gave her assent to a bilateral agreement to arbitrate.
That contract provided for the resolution by arbitration of all employment-related disputes, including claims arising under Title VII. Hooters claims the agreement to arbitrate is valid because Phillips twice signed it voluntarily.
Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 402-04, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967); see also Wick v. Atlantic Marine, Inc., 605 F.2d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1979). In this case, the challenge goes to the validity of the arbitration agreement itself.
Their agreement provided that Hooters was responsible for setting up such a forum by promulgating arbitration rules and procedures.
The Hooters rules also provide a mechanism for selecting a panel of three arbitrators that is crafted to ensure a biased decisionmaker.
Although Hooters may expand the scope of arbitration to any matter, "whether related or not to the Employee's Claim," the employee cannot raise "any matter not included in the Notice of Claim." Rules 4-2, 8-9.
The rules also grant Hooters the right to bring suit in court to vacate or modify an arbitral award when it can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the panel exceeded its authority.
In addition, the rules provide that upon 30 days notice Hooters, but not the employee, may cancel the agreement to arbitrate.
The National Academy of Arbitrators stated that the Hooters rules "violate fundamental concepts of fairness...and the integrity of the arbitration process."
