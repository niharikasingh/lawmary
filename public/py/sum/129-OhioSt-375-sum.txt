It is contended by the Mabley & Crew Company that there is no proof of the designation of Ida C. Borden as beneficiary under the certificate in question. 12 The name appears on the back of the certificate and, while it is typewritten, it is certainly a sufficient designation, taken in connection with the fact that Anna Work had it in her possession until her death. 13 There is just one question in this case, and that is the consideration for the issuance of this certificate.
It is true that Anna Work could not maintain an action on this certificate in her lifetime, as no right of action existed in her favor; but that fact did not prevent it from being enforceable, after her death, in the hands of Ida C. Borden. 14 This certificate was not a pure gratuity on the part of the Mabley & Crew Company, as there was a provision in the certificate to the effect that the payment  would not be made in the event of death unless Anna Work was still an employee of the company.
We find no trouble in upholding this contract. 22 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed. 23 Judgment affirmed
