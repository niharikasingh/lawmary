The issue in this case is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that prior to the termination of Social Security disability benefit payments the recipient be afforded an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.
In support of his contention that due process requires a pretermination hearing, Eldridge relied exclusively upon this Court's decision in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), which established a right to an "evidentiary hearing" prior to termination of welfare benefits.
The District Court concluded that the administrative procedures pursuant to which the Secretary had terminated Eldridge's benefits abridged his right to procedural    due process.
Reasoning that disability determinations may involve subjective judgments based on conflicting medical and nonmedical evidence, the District Court held that prior to termination of benefits Eldridge had to be afforded an evidentiary hearing of the type required for welfare beneficiaries under Title IV of the Social Security Act. 361 F. Supp., at 528.
The only avenue for judicial review is 42 U. S. C.   405 (g), which requires exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided under the Act as a jurisdictional prerequisite.
As construed in Salfi,   405 (g) requires only that there be a "final decision" by the Secretary with respect to the claim of entitlement to benefits.
The situation here is not identical to Salfi, for, while the    Secretary had no power to amend the statute alleged to be unconstitutional in that case, he does have authority to determine the timing and content of the procedures challenged here. 42 U. S. C.  405 (a).
Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of "liberty" or "property" interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment. The Secretary does not contend that procedural due process is inapplicable to terminations of Social Security disability benefits.
He recognizes, as has been implicit in our prior decisions, e. g., Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 80-81 (1971); Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401-402 (1971); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611 (1960), that the interest of an individual in continued receipt of these benefits is a statutorily created "property" interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 166 (POWELL, J., concurring in part) (1974); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-578 (1972); Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S., at 539; Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S., at 261-262.
Rather, the Secretary contends that the existing administrative procedures, detailed below, provide all the process    that is constitutionally due before a recipient can be deprived of that interest.
More precisely, our prior decisions    indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
State agencies make the initial determination whether a disability exists, when it began, and when it ceased. 42 U. S. C.   421 (a).
  In order to establish initial and continued entitlement to disability benefits a worker must demonstrate that he is unable "to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months...." 42 U. S. C.   423 (d) (1) (A).
Ibid. Whenever the agency's tentative assessment of the beneficiary's condition differs from his    own assessment, the beneficiary is informed that benefits may be terminated, provided a summary of the evidence upon which the proposed determination to terminate is based, and afforded an opportunity to review the medical reports and other evidence in his case file.
42 U. S. C.   423 (a) (1970 ed., Supp. III).   If the recipient seeks reconsideration by the state agency and the determination is adverse, the SSA reviews the reconsideration determination and notifies the recipient of the decision.
If this hearing results in an adverse decision, the claimant is entitled to request discretionary review by the SSA Appeals Council,   404.945, and finally may obtain judicial review. 42 U. S. C.   405 (g); 20 CFR  404.951 (1975).
Despite the elaborate character of the administrative procedures provided by the Secretary, the courts    below held them to be constitutionally inadequate, concluding that due process requires an evidentiary hearing prior to termination.
In order to remain eligible for benefits the disabled worker must demonstrate by means of "medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques," 42 U. S. C.   423 (d) (3), that he is unable "to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment...."   423 (d) (1) (A) (emphasis supplied).
The potential value of an evidentiary hearing, or even oral presentation to the decisionmaker,    is substantially less in this context than in Goldberg. The decision in Goldberg also was based on the Court's conclusion that written submissions were an inadequate substitute for oral presentation because they did not provide an effective means for the recipient to communicate his case to the decisionmaker.
  Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision.
We conclude that an evidentiary hearing is not required prior to the termination of disability benefits and that the present administrative procedures fully comport with due process.
