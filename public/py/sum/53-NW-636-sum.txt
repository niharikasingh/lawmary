One who takes property from the possession of another can only rebut this presumption by showing a superior title in himself, or in some way connecting himself with one who has.
One who has acquired the possession of property, whether by finding, bailment, or by mere tort, has a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property.
Any other rule would lead to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property had once passed out of the possession of the rightful owner.
