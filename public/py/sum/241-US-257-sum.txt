It then alleges that the defendants have falsely and maliciously libeled and slandered the plaintiff's title to the pump by stating that the pump and certain parts thereof are infringements upon the defendant's pump and certain parts thereof and that without probable cause they have brought suits against some parties who are using the plaintiff's pump and that they are threatening suits against all who use it.
The allegation of the defendants' libel or slander is repeated in slightly varying form but it all comes to statements to various people that the plaintiff was infringing the defendants' patent and that the defendant  would sue both seller and buyer if the plaintiff's pump was used.
The material statement complained of is that the plaintiff infringes â€” which may be true notwithstanding the plaintiff's patent.
The fact that the justification may involve the validity and infringement of a patent is no more material to the question under what law the suit is brought than it would be in an action of contract.
