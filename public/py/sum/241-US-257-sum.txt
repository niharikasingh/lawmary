The allegation of the defendants' libel or slander is repeated in slightly varying form but it all comes to statements to various people that the plaintiff was infringing the defendants' patent and that the defendant  would sue both seller and buyer if the plaintiff's pump was used.
The material statement complained of is that the plaintiff infringes â€” which may be true notwithstanding the plaintiff's patent.
The fact that the justification may involve the validity and infringement of a patent is no more material to the question under what law the suit is brought than it would be in an action of contract.
The State is master of the whole matter, and if it saw fit to do away with actions of this type altogether, no one, we imagine, would suppose that they still could be maintained under the patent laws of the United States. Judgment reversed
