But I also agree with Justice GINSBURG that there are some state procedural rules that federal courts must apply in diversity cases because they function as a part of the State's definition of substantive rights and remedies.
If no federal rule applies, a federal court must follow the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1652, and make the "relatively unguided Erie choice," Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136, to determine whether the state law is the "rule of decision."
The Enabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in the "relatively unguided Erie choice," id. at 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136, but instead instructs only that federal rules cannot "abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right," § 2072(b).
To the contrary, federal rules must be interpreted with some degree of "sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies," Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), and applied to diversity cases against the background of Congress' command that such rules not alter substantive rights and with consideration of "the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts," Hanna, 380 U.S. at 473, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
If the federal rule does not apply or can operate alongside the state rule, then there is no "Ac[t] of Congress" governing that particular question, 28 U.S.C. § 1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny.
In other instances, the rule "when fairly construed," Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U.S. at 4, 107 S.Ct. 967, with "sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies," Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, will not collide with the state law. If, on the other hand, the federal rule is "sufficiently broad to control the issue before the Court," such that there is a "direct collision," Walker, 446 U.S. at 749-750, 100 S.Ct. 1978, the court must decide whether application of the federal rule "represents a valid exercise" of the "rulemaking authority...bestowed on this Court by the Rules Enabling Act." Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U.S. at 5, 107 S.Ct. 967; see also Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 427, n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211; Hanna, 380 U.S. at 471-474, 85 S.Ct. 1136.
See, e.g., Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 503, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 149 L.Ed.2d 32 (2001) (avoiding an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) that "would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act" contained in § 2072(b)). And when such a "saving" construction is not possible and the rule would violate the Enabling Act, federal courts cannot apply the rule.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b) (mandating that federal rules "shall not" alter "any substantive right" (emphasis added)); Hanna, 380 U.S. at 473, 85 S.Ct. 1136 ("[A] court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act. .
But it ignores the second limitation  that such rules also "not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right," § 2072(b) (emphasis added), and in so doing ignores the balance that Congress struck between uniform rules of federal procedure and respect for a State's construction of its own rights and remedies.
It also ignores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright § 4509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555 U.S., at ___, 129 S.Ct. at 1194-95, that counsel against judicially created rules displacing state substantive law. Although the plurality appears to agree with much of my interpretation of § 2072, see ante at 1445-1446, it nonetheless rejects that approach for two reasons, both of which are mistaken.
The Court, therefore, had no occasion to consider whether the particular application of the Federal Rules in question would offend the Enabling Act. [130 S.Ct. 1455] Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to the resolution of the case because the matter at issue, requiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to "substantive rights" under the Enabling Act. Although most state rules bearing on the litigation process are adopted for some policy reason, few seemingly "procedural" rules define the scope of a substantive right or remedy.
If the Federal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then perhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been different. Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary. III Justice GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as whether and how to  apply a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to join plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that "defines the dimensions" of a statecreated claim dictates the opposite answer.
Although, as discussed infra at 1469-1471, I do not accept the dissent's view of § 901(b), I also do not see how the dissent's interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view. I agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that courts should "avoi[d] immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on state prerogatives," post at 1461-1462, and should in some instances "interpre[t] the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies," post at 1462 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Applying Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a class action such as this one, a federal court must inquire whether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York's rights or remedies, and thereby violate the Enabling Act. This inquiry is not always a simple one because "[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that cannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case," Wright § 4508, at 232-233, and almost "any rule can be said to have...`substantive effects,' affecting society's distribution of risks and rewards," Ely 724, n. 170.
But given that there are two plausible competing narratives, it seems obvious to me that we  should respect the plain textual reading of § 901(b), a rule in New York's procedural code about when to certify class actions brought under any source of law, and respect Congress' decision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal courts.
Accordingly, I concur in part and concur in the judgment
