The action is on a judgment entered by default in a Florida state court, a jury having assessed the damages.
The affidavits submitted by the appellee deemed to be true for the purpose of testing the alleged error of dismissing the complaint established that he was a resident of New York and never lived in Florida.
Upon appellee's return to New York he received a letter from appellant stating that her mother was dying in Ireland; that she was leaving the United States for good to go to her mother; that she could not go without seeing the appellee once more; and that she wanted to discuss her affairs with him before she left.
The attorney invited appellee to his office, and upon his arrival he found one of the lawyers for the appellant there.
These facts and reasonable deductions therefrom convincingly establish that the appellee was induced to enter the jurisdiction of the state of Florida by a fraud perpetrated upon him by the appellant in falsely representing her mother's illness, her intention to leave the United States, and her love and affection for him, when her sole purpose and apparent thought was to induce him to come within the Florida jurisdiction so as to serve him in an action for damages.
The first inquiry is what faith and credit would be given to this judgment within the state of Florida.
This judgment is attacked for fraud perpetrated upon the appellee which goes to the jurisdiction of the Florida court over his person.
The appellee was not required to proceed against the judgment in Florida.
The appellee was not required to make out a defense on the merits to the suit in Florida.
Judgment affirmed
