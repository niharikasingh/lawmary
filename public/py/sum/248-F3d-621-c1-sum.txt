Instead, the Court held, after the party has failed in an effort to convince the trial court to strike a juror for cause, that party has "the option of letting [the prospective juror] sit on the petit jury and, upon conviction, pursuing a Sixth Amendment challenge on appeal."
Even with respect to the prospective jurors who were challenged unsuccessfully for cause, the chances that any of those decisions by the trial court amounted to reversible error are just that — chances — and the responsible lawyer cannot count on convincing an appellate court later that the ruling was in error.
If there are left-over peremptories and the plaintiff has failed to convince the court to strike a certain juror for cause, it is at least imaginable that a decision not to use an available peremptory challenge on that juror might amount to a waiver of the right to assert that the juror should not have sat.
