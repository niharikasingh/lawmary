 What the present decision establishes as a principle is that one may remain on private property against the will of the owner and contrary to the law of the state so long as the only objection to his presence is that he is exercising an asserted right to spread there his religious views.
Of course, such principle may subsequently be restricted by this Court to the precise facts of this case â€” that is to private property in a company town where the owner for his own advantage has permitted a restricted public use by his licensees and invitees.
An owner of property may very well have been willing for the public to use the private passway for business purposes and yet have been unwilling to furnish space for street trades or a location for the practice of religious exhortations by itinerants.
Although in Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, an ordinance forbidding the summonsing of the occupants of a dwelling to receive handbills was held invalid because in conflict with the freedom of speech and press, this Court pointed out at page 147 that, after warning, the property owner would be protected from annoyance.
Even though we have reached the point where this Court is required to force private owners to open their property for the practice there of religious activities or propaganda distasteful  to the owner, because of the public interest in freedom of speech and religion, there is no need for the application of such a doctrine here.
Appellant, as we have said, was free to engage in such practices on the public highways, without becoming a trespasser on the company's property
