Approximately eight months after the trial, the Cummings filed a motion in the district court for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) based on alleged discovery misconduct on GM's part.
GM made its motion first, moving for judgment as a matter of law with regard to all claims, including the alleged defective seat, seat belt, failure to warn, and punitive damages claims.
The Cummings responded to GM's contentions, and then the court directed them to make their motion for judgment as a matter of law.
The Cummings filed a timely appeal, asserting that (1) they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to liability, and (2) the trial court abused its discretion in its rulings on various discovery motions.
GM contends that the Cummings have failed to preserve this issue for appeal, stating (1) the Cummings moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence only on the defense of product misuse and not on liability generally, and (2) the Cummings failed to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict.
A party challenging the sufficiency of the evidence during a civil trial must make a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case is submitted to the jury, in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a).
Id. A motion for judgment as a matter of law also alerts the court to a claim of insufficient evidence before the case is submitted to the jury so the court is not faced with such a claim after the fact when the court's ability to address the motion is limited.
Q.E.R., Inc. v. Hickerson, 880 F.2d 1178, 1180 (10th Cir.1989). On appeal, this court reviews de novo the district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, Cadena v. Pacesetter Corp., 224 F.3d 1203, 1208 (10th Cir.2000), applying the same standard as applied in the district court, Q.E.R., 880 F.2d at 1180.
F.D.I.C. v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 20 F.3d 1070, 1076 (10th Cir.1994); Green Constr. Co. v. Kan. Power & Light Co., 1 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir.1993); Comcoa, Inc. v. NEC Tels., Inc., 931 F.2d 655, 663 n. 11 (10th Cir.1991). The motion must also be sufficiently certain as to the issues raised.
Rule 50(a) requires that a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence "specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment."
Davoll v. Webb, 194 F.3d 1116, 1136 (10th Cir.1999). When determining whether a particular issue has been raised in a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court has liberally construed such motions, Aguinaga v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, 993 F.2d 1463, 1470 (10th Cir.1993), stating that "[t]echnical precision is not necessary in stating grounds for the motion so long as the trial court is aware of the movant's position," United States v. Fenix & Scisson, Inc., 360 F.2d 260, 266 (10th Cir.1966); see also Anderson, 933 F.2d at 1504.
Id. In this case, the Cummings moved for judgment as a matter of law with regard to the defense of misuse only and requested a jury instruction on this issue.
See Morrison Knudsen Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 175 F.3d 1221, 1246 (10th Cir.1999) (holding such a failure does not bar appellant "from appealing the issue of the sufficiency of the  evidence"); Marshall v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 874 F.2d 1373, 1385 (10th Cir.1989) (holding "failure to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not bar an appeal"); Hansen v. Vidal, 237 F.2d 453, 454 (10th Cir.1956) (holding motion for judgment as a matter of law not a "condition precedent to appeal from a final judgment").
The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that in the absence of a motion for judgment as a matter of law following an adverse jury verdict "made in the trial court within ten days after reception of a verdict [, Rule 50(b)] forbids the trial judge or an appellate court to enter such a judgment."
As to whether the court should have granted the Cummings judgment as a matter of law with regard to GM's liability generally, because the Cummings' Rule 50(a) motion was limited to the issue of GM's misuse defense, we review the sufficiency of the evidence only for plain error constituting a miscarriage of justice.
We review the district court's denial of the Cummings' motion for judgment as a matter of law as to GM's defense of misuse de novo, although as above noted we are limited to determining whether the Cummings are entitled to a new trial.
Construing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to GM, and refraining "from weighing the evidence, passing on the credibility of witnesses, or substituting our judgment for that of the jury," Brown v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 11 F.3d 1559, 1563 (10th Cir.1993), we find there was evidence supporting both parties' positions, and consequently the court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitting the issue to the jury.
B. Discovery Rulings With regard to the Cummings' appeal of the trial court's discovery rulings, we discern three main arguments: (1) GM failed to respond adequately to requests for discovery; (2) GM withheld names and locations of persons responsible for the design and implementation of the seat system; and (3) GM failed timely to produce research, development, and testing, including the failure to provide access to GM's databases.
GWN Petroleum Corp. v. OK-Tex Oil & Gas, Inc., 998 F.2d 853, 858 (10th Cir.1993). This standard of review applies equally to the denial of a motion to compel, Motley v. Marathon Oil Co., 71 F.3d 1547, 1550 (10th Cir.1995) (noting a denial of a motion to compel discovery will not be disturbed  absent an abuse of discretion), and the grant of a protective order, Kidd v. Taos Ski Valley, Inc., 88 F.3d 848, 853 (10th Cir.1996) ("The decision of a district court to enter a protective order under Rule 26(c) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.").
The magistrate ruled the newest version of Rule 26 would govern in this case, including the 2000 amendments, I Aplt.App. at 26 n. 5, and the Cummings did not object to this holding.
The Cummings filed the Rule 60(b) motion within a year of the judgment.
White v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d 1414, 1425 (10th Cir.1990). The Cummings waited seven months after discovery of the tests to file the motion.
The Cummings assert that the videos in question show "infant-sized crash dummies squirt[ing] out of their safety seats in simulated accidents similar to that suffered by the Cummings," II Aplt. Br. at 6; they argue such evidence would have been crucial in countering GM's defense, as the videos show that a scenario involving a forward facing child seat would have resulted in injury to the infant in this case.
Given the scope of discovery set forth by the district court, it does not appear the failure to produce the videos in response to the Cummings' discovery requests was "misconduct" on the part of GM. The Cummings point to two cases, Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 925-26 (1st Cir.1988), and Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th Cir.1978), to support their argument that GM's conduct constituted "misconduct."
