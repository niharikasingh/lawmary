True, Chief Judge FULD in his concurring opinion in the Tooker case (Tooker v. Lopez, 24 N.Y.2d 569, 583, at p. 584) took the view that there had already occurred sufficient experience to lay down some rules of law which would reduce the instability and uncertainty created by the recent departures from traditional lex loci delictus.
In this case, none would have ever assumed that New York law should be applied just because one of the two defendants was a New York resident and his automobile was New York insured, except for the overbroad statements of Currie doctrine in the Tooker case (24 N.Y.2d 569, supra), stemming from one particular school of academic thinking in the field of conflicts law (see the concurring opn. by Judge BURKE in the Tooker case, 24 N Y 2d, at pp. 586-592, and for that matter, the dissenting opn. by Judge BERGAN, in this case).
The conclusion, however, rests simply on the proposition that plaintiff has failed by her allegations to establish that the relationship to this State was sufficient    to displace the normal rule that the lex loci delictus should be applied, the accident being associated with Ontario, from inception to tragic termination, except for adventitious facts and where the lawsuit was brought
