The trial judge made the following award: Pain, suffering and disability       $60,000.00 Loss of wages through 1972            20,232.09 Impairment of earning capacity   (anticipated future loss of wages)  26,443.00 Medical expenses (stipulated)          7,930.90                                      __________                             Total   $114,605.99  Loss of Wages Through 1972 At the time of the 1969 accident Edwards was earning $1. per hour and as senior driver had first chance for any overtime work at time and a half.
It is reasonably probable that if Edwards had not been injured, he would have continued working in the same position and furthermore would have earned approximately the amount of wages earned by his replacement as senior driver.
The expert assumed that Edwards' earnings for 1973 as a security guard (based on an extension of his wages earned through the date of trial) would be $6,329.00, and further assumed that if Edwards had not been injured, he would have earned $8,725.00, the amount he was informed Edwards' replacement earned in 1972.
 On the basis of these assumptions and of the statistic that a person of Edwards' age had a work life expectancy in 1973 of 15. years, the actuary calculated that Edwards would require a fund of $26,443.00 at time of trial to provide him with $2,396.00 per year over the next 15. years (at a 4Â½% discount rate.)
In the present case the trial judge properly considered that prior to the accident Edwards was in good physical condition, had an excellent work record, and had earned the highest wages of the 13 company drivers.
On these considerations he properly concluded Edwards would have earned top driver's wages over his future work life expectancy except for the negligently inflicted injury.
In the present case, however, the actuary did not really employ either gross or net income for his computation, but utilized the difference between the wages Edwards probably would have earned in 1973 had he not been injured and the wages he actually earned in 1973.
After considering all of the pertinent factors, and again observing that damages for loss of future wages must be based on sound judicial discretion rather than on absolute mathematical formulas, we conclude the amount awarded by the trial judge does not constitute an abuse of the "much discretion" vested in him by C. C. art. 1934(3).
The trial judge also commented that Edwards would "not be a whole man for the rest of his life", particularly noting that Edwards' family and recreational activities with his three young children would be permanently curtailed and that he was forced to transfer from a job he "obviously enjoyed" to one as "a bland security guard," because he was concerned primarily with supporting his family in any type of employment he could obtain in his physical condition.
