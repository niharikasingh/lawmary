"(21) Soon after its organization in 1897, respondent adopted and has since maintained a policy of fixing and enforcing minimum resale prices at which Cream of Wheat should be sold by its vendees, and, among the means adopted by it to that end, it has advised its agents and customers and prospective customers from time to time of its resale prices, and requested of its customers and prospective customers that they observe such resale prices in all their sales, declaring its purpose to refuse to accept or fill any further orders from those who should sell at prices below said minimum, or from those who supplied dealers who so cut its resale prices.
He then states the policy of the company to refuse further sales to dealers who cut respondent's resale prices, also to advise other customers of such refusal and cut off any customer who thereafter sells to such resale price cutters.
"(25) The consideration referred to in respondent's letters, that members of chain stores `cannot resist the temptation to cut the resale price below a figure which the retailer not connected with a chain store, but buying at the retail price directly from the wholesaler, can afford to sell it,' emphasizes the need which respondent felt of being assured in advance that the chain stores would not cut its resale prices, and the importance to it of securing some binding agreement or assurance in order to keep them in line.
"(29) Respondent's agents have been fully advised by respondent of its policy as to securing the observance of its resale prices, and have been furnished with copies of letters addressed to customers by respondent bearing on this subject in the agents' respective territories, and its agents have, at its direction and as part of their business relations to respondent, advised customers of respondent's resale prices and its terms of dealing or refusing to deal in respect thereto, and have conferred with customers and prospective customers as to their observance of such resale prices in the future, and reported to respondent agreements secured from dealers that they would observe such resale prices.
Lamont, Corliss & Co., of New York, agents of respondent, were asked by respondent to advise it, should John T. Connor Company, of Boston, Mass., which had been accepted as a customer by respondent, fail to observe respondent's suggested or requested resale prices for Cream of Wheat. Commission's Exhibit 14, especially letter of 5/27/21."
"(30) Respondent has utilized co-operative methods by which it has solicited and secured from customers or prospective customers themselves, or from other dealers or trade associations, information and reports as to whether or not such customers or prospective customers have maintained and are maintaining, or are disposed to maintain generally resale prices fixed by producers, or respondent's resale prices in particular, and solicited and secured reports, from customers, of customers who failed to observe its resale prices, and has investigated and verified such reports through further reports secured from customers as to such instances of price cutting, all with a view to refusing further sales to customers found to have cut its resale prices.
In December, 1921, respondent addressed such a letter to wholesalers in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Washington, D. C., referring to reports of price cutting, disavowing any desire for agreement of observance of its resale prices, stating that in case of price cutting `we will undoubtedly refuse to sell such customer any further quantities of Cream of Wheat,' and concluding: `In order that there may be no question about this matter, will you please write us, upon your receipt of this letter, and advise us definitely whether you now are, or have in the past, sold Cream of Wheat to your retail trade at a price less than that requested of you by us.'
"(31) On complaint of competitor customers, respondent cut off price-cutter customers' supplies of Cream of Wheat and refused further to sell Cream of Wheat to such price-cutter customers, because such customers sold Cream of Wheat below suggested or requested minimum resale prices named by respondent.
"(32) On complaint of competitor customers, respondent refused to sell supplies of Cream of Wheat to price-cutter customers at the same prices and terms upon which it sold its product to customers who observed its suggested or requested minimum resale prices.
Respondent placed such price-cutter customers upon probation, while penalizing them as to prices charged to them for Cream of Wheat. If, after probation over a period, the price-cutter customers had shown that they had reformed and had observed respondent's suggested or requested minimum resale prices on Cream of Wheat, respondent reinstated them upon the understanding that they should continue to observe such resale prices.
"February 7, 1921, upon information secured from Ariss, Campbell & Gault, sales agents at Portland, Or., that Mason, Ehrman & Co., wholesale grocers had sold Cream of Wheat at $8. a case, while the resale price named by respondent was $9 a case, respondent refused to sell further supplies of Cream of Wheat to Mason, Ehrman & Co., which it had theretofore supplied, giving as its reason that Mason, Ehrman & Co. had not observed the suggestion or requested minimum resale price named by respondent on its product (Commission's Exhibit 35, letters dated 2/7/21, 2/19/21, 2/25/21, 2/28/21, 3/4/21)," and others who it alleged it had been informed by its agents there they had cut prices.
"(35) When respondent secured, through advertisements, price lists, agents, customers, or from other sources, information of price cutting by its customers in the resale of Cream of Wheat, it wrote letters reiterating its policy that it would refuse to sell to a customer further supplies of Cream of Wheat, should the customer fail to respect or adhere to respondent's suggested or requested minimum resale prices.
"(38) Among other features of respondent's policy and practices regarding resale prices stated by respondent's president and general manager in the correspondence with the National Chain Store Grocer's Association *46 is the following: After stating that, in case a customer sells Cream of Wheat at less than the requested resale price, respondent refuses to fill any of his future orders: `In addition to the above will say, in case that any wholesale customer of ours does not see fit to comply with our request with regard to resale price, and as a consequence we refuse sales to him, we notify all of our other customers within a certain radius of our action in the premises, and request them in turn not to sell any of our goods to the party to whom we have refused sales.
"Respondent admitted that it `advised other customers, in some cases, that respondent had refused further sales to customers because of price cutting, suggesting that, `in general interest of the trade, it would be good policy for you to decline filling any orders' from them, and that `it would be for your best interests to decline to fill any orders for Cream of Wheat which they may see fit to place with you,' and in some cases declaring, variously, that, if customers refuse to observe this request, respondent `refuses to sell,' or would refuse or intended to refuse to sell, such customers, and in at least one case respondent refused further sales to a customer because he had sold Cream of Wheat to another customer to whom respondent had refused to sell because of price cutting.'
"(39) After having stricken from its list of customers dealers who had failed to maintain respondent's suggested or requested resale prices in the sale of Cream of Wheat, respondent has, by means of letters or through its agents, notified other dealers of its action, and requested other dealers not to sell Cream of Wheat to the customers thus cut off, reinforcing respondent's request by an intimation or a threat that such sales to the rejected dealer would result in the seller also being cut off from supplies of Cream of Wheat by the respondent," stating the names of other dealers to whom letters to the same effect were sent by petitioner.
"(40) In some cases, dealers or associations of dealers have collected for respondent data as to whether its suggested or requested minimum resale prices were being maintained and aided in circulating statements as to its policy of minimum resale price control in the sale of Cream of Wheat. * * * Respondent co-operated with the Iowa-Nebraska-Minnesota Grocers' Association in sending to the members of that association, in the form of a circular letter of the association, a portion of a letter from respondent to H. A. Marr in which was set forth respondent's resale price maintenance policy and the consequence of failure by dealers to observe and adhere to such policy.
Upon these findings the Commission made the following order: "Now, therefore, it is ordered that the respondent, Cream of Wheat Company, its officers, agents, employees, and successors, do cease and desist from carrying into effect its policy of securing the observance of minimum resale prices for its product, by co-operative methods in which the respondent and its distributors, customers and agents undertake to prevent others from obtaining the company's product at less than the prices designated by it, or from selling to others who fail to observe such prices Â— (1) by seeking and securing, directly or through its sales agents, contracts, agreements or understandings with customers or prospective customers that they will maintain the resale prices designated by it, or that they will co-operate with it to secure the observance by others of said resale prices; (2) by the practice of (a) soliciting and securing from customers or prospective customers themselves or from dealers or trade associations, information as to whether or not such customers or prospective customers have maintained and are maintaining, or are disposed to maintain generally resale prices fixed by producers, or, respondent's resale prices in particular; and (b) soliciting and securing reports from customers, or customers who fail to observe its resale prices, and investigating and verifying such reports through further reports secured from customers as to such instances of price cutting, all with a view to refusing further sales to customers found to have cut its resale prices; (3) by notifying other customers, in case of refusal by respondent of further sales to price cutters, of such refusal and requiring them not to sell such price cutters on pain of themselves being refused further sales; (4) by employing its sales agents to assist in such *48 plan by reporting dealers who have failed to observe its resale prices, and to secure adherence thereto from customers or prospective customers, and furnishing said agents the names of customers to whom it has refused further sales because of price cutting, and instructing them not to sell to such customers; (5) by requiring an extra price for its product from price cutters in order to secure from them assurance of their future observance of its resale prices as a condition of reinstatement on the regular basis; or (6) by utilizing any other equivalent co-operative means of accomplishing the maintenance of prices fixed by respondent.
While paragraph 6 should be construed in connection with the preceding paragraphs as construed by us, by applying Lord Tenterden's rule of "ejusdem generis," still, in order that there may be no misapprehension on the part of the petitioner as to what is intended by the Commission by the broad language used in this paragraph, we are of the opinion that the requests should have been granted.
