I confess that I am somewhat puzzled why the plaintiffs in this litigation are so insistent that the regional distributor and the retail dealer, the petitioners here, who handled the ill-fated Audi automobile involved in this litigation, be named defendants.
It would appear that the manufacturer and the  importer, whose subjectability to Oklahoma jurisdiction is not challenged before this Court, ought not to be judgmentproof.
It is not too much to anticipate at the time of distribution and at the time of retail sale that this Audi would be in Oklahoma.
My position need not now take me beyond the automobile and the professional who does business by way of distributing and retailing automobiles.
All will depend on the "contact" that the Court sees fit to perceive in the individual case
