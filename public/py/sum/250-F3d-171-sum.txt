This appeal from the denial of that motion raises several thorny issues: whether a discharged lawyer who has a charging lien it believes is in jeopardy by ongoing litigation possesses an interest justifying intervention as of right in that litigation; whether the discharged attorney's interests are adequately represented in the ongoing litigation; and whether the former attorney moved timely to intervene.
The sole issue is whether the Butler law firm — GBJ's former counsel in its action against Sequa — may intervene in the suit to protect its asserted interest in the outcome.
In June of that year a magistrate judge determined that the dismissal was without cause and, pursuant to New York law, see N.Y. Judiciary Law § 475 (McKinney 1983), fixed a charging lien in the amount of $2,934,695. in favor of Butler upon any recovery GBJ had in its action against Sequa. The charging lien is the subject matter of Butler's appeal.
In a March 31, 1999 order the district court had referred the tax recapture issue to a Special Master, and Butler claims that its subsequent assistance to GBJ on this issue was exhaustive, including: prepping GBJ's counsel on discovery methods and trial techniques in advance of a July 1999 hearing before the Special Master; identifying and arranging for a tax expert to refute Sequa's expert report; purchasing two hearing transcripts for GBJ in the course of the sessions before the Special Master; and drafting GBJ's August 14, 1999 post-hearing memorandum, which was submitted to the Special Master. Butler provided this aid purportedly because it had been forced to make a "Hobson's choice": either expend its own time and money to ensure that GBJ would succeed in its claims against Sequa, so that Butler could later recover its charging lien, or do nothing and likely lose the lien.
It provides that [u]pon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
Id. Butler was found deficient in three of the requirements: specifically, the district court held its motion was untimely, the law firm had not established it possessed an interest in the action justifying intervention, and even if it had such an interest, that interest was already adequately protected by counsel for GBJ. Because we think the trial court's ruling finds support under two of its three rationales, we need not rule on the third one.
We have not had occasion to address whether a discharged attorney's charging lien is a sufficient interest to support intervention as of right into a client's underlying action.
B. Rule 24(a) Despite the substantial value of the charging lien, and its potential impairment by an adverse judgment, it is not certain whether this lien qualifies as an interest sufficient to justify Butler's intervention as of right into the dispute between GBJ and Sequa. To begin with, it is questionable whether a discharged attorney's intervention into a former client's action fits within the language of the Federal Rules. Rule 24(a) provides in pertinent part that the putative intervenor must "claim[] an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action."
C. Client's Control of Litigation Distinct from the question of whether a charging lien falls within the language of Rule 24 are the public policy repercussions that arise when discharged counsel is permitted to intervene as of right in his former client's action to protect an interest in legal fees.
We agree that substantial policy interests are implicated by allowing a discharged attorney to intervene in a former client's action as a matter of right.
Since we are not presently persuaded by the reasoning of those handful of courts that have dealt with this issue, and the district court's decision is fully justified on other grounds, we decline today to decide whether the financial stake of discharged counsel in its former client's action is the type of interest contemplated by Rule 24(a).
II Adequacy of Representation It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to hold that Butler's interests were already adequately protected by GBJ, an existing party to the dispute, and to deny the motion to intervene on that basis.
Butler concedes, as it must, that its interests are aligned with those of GBJ, for its recovery upon the charging lien is predicated upon a favorable result for GBJ on the claims against Sequa. Cf. Ionian Shipping Co. v. British Law Ins. Co., 426 F.2d 186, 191 (2d Cir.1970) (denying intervention as of right to assignee of mortgagee in action by mortgagor against its insurer, because assignee and mortgagor had identical interests in that the former could only recover if the latter's suit was successful).
See United States v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 62 F.R.D. 530, 538 (S.D.N.Y.1974) (denying motion by law firm to intervene in client's action for purposes of asserting work product privilege); see also Daggett v. Comm'n on Govtl. Ethics & Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 111 (1st Cir.1999) (rejecting argument that there is an exclusive list of circumstances that rebut a presumption of adequacy).
As Butler acknowledges, it began assisting counsel for GBJ in late 1998, and attempted to submit an amicus brief to the district court the following March. We believe that GBJ's purported solicitation of help from a law firm that it had previously discharged should have alerted Butler to any possible danger that its charging lien might not be adequately represented.
In this nearly nine-year-old litigation, however, allowing Butler to intervene, at what the district court called the "eleventh hour," would cause more delay, see Sequa Corp., No. 91 Civ. 8675, slip op. at 4, and provide only the limited benefit of allowing a second party to argue the merits of GBJ's case.
The third factor gives us some pause, because assuming Butler's interest is not otherwise adequately represented, the prejudice to the Butler law firm of not allowing it to intervene is appreciable.
Although we affirm the district court's denial of Butler's motion to intervene in its own right, the law firm may still promote GBJ's interests by again working alongside its former client's new counsel.
Consequently, considering the nearly one year delay before making its motion, the late stage of litigation, and the unusual circumstance of the heretofore cooperative relationship between Butler and GBJ, it was not an abuse of the district court's discretion to rule that appellant's motion to intervene was untimely.
