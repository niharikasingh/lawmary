Upon a motion by appellees for partial summary judgment, the district court dismissed appellants' claims for sleep time compensation, holding that the claim was barred by the FLSA's three-year statute of limitations, and dismissed appellants' individual capacity claims against appellees, concluding that in their individual capacities, appellees were not FLSA employers.
Further, FLSA regulations specifically address the compensability of sleep time, providing at 29 C.F.R. § 553.222(c) that a public employer may exclude sleep time of firefighters who are on a scheduled tour of duty of more than 24 hours, if, "but only if there is an expressed or implied agreement between the employer and the employees to exclude such time" from hours worked.
ANALYSIS I. Though the coercion alleged by appellants, and the implementation of the City's post-Garcia pay plan occurred more than three years prior to their filing suit, appellants contended that their suit was not barred by the FLSA's three-year statute of limitations, 29 U.S.C. § 255(a), since they were not challenging the implementation of the pay system, but rather contended that each paycheck they received under the new pay system constituted a continuing violation of the FLSA and allowed them to recover for violations occurring during the  limitations period.
Appellees contended, and the district court agreed, that appellants' claim for sleep time compensation was time-barred since appellants' claim was based on a singular, discrete act — the City's implementation of a pay system based on allegedly void waivers — which occurred more than three years prior to appellants' filing suit.
The court likewise concluded that as to those employees who held the position of fire captain at the time the new pay plan was implemented, their claims that they were not properly classified and treated as exempt employees were time-barred.
The issue in a case such as this, where a claim is made that a continuing violation has occurred so as to, in effect, extend the time for filing suit, "is whether the reduction in pay was a single act of discrimination under the FLSA, hence barred by its three year statute of limitations, or whether the reduction effected in each subsequent paycheck constitutes a violation of the Act, thus making the complaint timely, at least in part."
Hendrix v. Yazoo City, 911 F.2d 1102 (5th Cir.1990). As this court explained in Hendrix, the continuing violation theory encompasses two types of cases: The first includes cases in which the original violation occurred outside the statute of limitations, but is closely related to other violations that are not time-barred.
See also Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980) (where the only alleged discrimination occurred at the time plaintiff was denied tenure, the statute of limitations commenced at the time of that decision, even though the effects of the denial of tenure did not occur until later); United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977) ("challenge to a neutral system may not be predicated on the mere fact that a past event which has no present legal significance has affected the calculation of seniority credit, even if the past event might at one time have justified a valid claim against the employer.")
Applying this analysis, the district court concluded that the City had simply "move[d] to a facially valid postFLSA policy from the pre-FLSA facially valid policy...." While appellants acknowledge the significance of facial neutrality in determining whether application of a policy will be found to constitute a continuing violation, they contend that the district court erred in concluding that the City's post-Garcia pay policy was facially valid.
In the court's opinion, however, the district court properly construed the FLSA agreements or waivers as an integral part of the City's pay policy and concluded that the policy  was facially valid.
The sole basis for appellants' seeking to impose liability against the City for sleep time compensation is their claim that the City, in the course of devising the new pay policy, coerced them, in August 1985, to relinquish their FLSA rights under threat of termination and thereafter, in October 1985, implemented a pay system predicated on those waivers.
Applying the test established in Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., 715 F.2d 971 (5th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 232, 93 L.Ed.2d 158 (1986), for defining precisely when the act or acts of discrimination occurred, the district court concluded, and properly so, that there was a single violation which took place at the time the City's post-Garcia pay plan was activated.
The allegation, in short, simply formed a part of the basis for their claim that the City violated FLSA, and therefore, the court's conclusion that the FLSA statute of limitations operates to bar appellants' claims relating to the City's implementation of the new pay policy necessarily disposes of any state law issues.
III. Appellants maintain that the district court erred in granting a defense motion in limine to exclude the admission of testimony and reports of appellants' damages expert, Dan McClemore. The district judge excluded the expert's testimony based on his determination that appellants had not complied with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26(e)(1)(B), which requires a party to supplement interrogatory responses with respect to "the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the person is expected to testify, and the substance of the person's testimony."
Appellants argue that the district court was precluded from excluding the expert's testimony as a sanction for their having failed to respond to discovery requests, since they did provide responses to the City's expert interrogatories and the City never moved to compel any further response.
These issues have been rendered moot by this court's conclusion that the district court properly dismissed the claims for sleep time pay, coupled with the jury's verdict for the City on appellants' claim for compensation for sleep interrupted time.
The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED
