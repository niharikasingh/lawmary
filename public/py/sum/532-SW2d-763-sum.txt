The claimed right to the use of the roadway is twofold: by prescription and by estoppel.
The lower court determined that a right to the use of the roadway by prescription had not been established, but that it had been established by estoppel.
As to the issue on estoppel, we have long recognized that a right to the use of a roadway over the lands of another may be established by estoppel.
In Gibbs v. Anderson, 288 Ky. 488, 156 S.W.2d 876 (1941), Gibbs claimed the right, by estoppel, to the use of a roadway over the lands of Anderson. The lower court denied the claim.
The evidence discloses that during the period of preparation for the construction of appellees' home and during the time the house was being built, appellees were permitted to use the roadway as ingress and egress for workmen, for hauling machinery and material to the building site, for construction of the dwelling, and for making improvements generally to the premises.
The use of the roadway by appellees to get to their home from the public highway, the use of the roadway to take in heavy equipment and material and supplies for construction of the residence, the general improvement of the premises, the maintenance of the roadway, and the construction by appellees of a $25,000 residence, all with the actual consent of appellants or at least with their tacit approval, clearly demonstrates the rule laid down in Lashley Telephone Co. v. Durbin, supra, that the license to use the subject roadway may not be revoked.
The evidence justifies the finding of the lower court that the right to the use of the roadway had been established by estoppel.
The judgment is affirmed
