The trial judge granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Kress on the conspiracy allegation and, after full presentation of evidence by the petitioner, granted a motion for a directed verdict in favor of the respondent on the custom allegation.
I think the trial court and the Court of Appeals which affirmed were wrong in allowing summary judgment on the conspiracy allegation.
The store filed affidavits denying any such conspiracy and the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that petitioner had not alleged any basic facts sufficient to support a finding of conspiracy.
The trial judge surveyed the evidence and concluded that it was insufficient to prove the existence of a custom of not serving white people in the company of Negroes. He thereupon took the case away from the jury, directing a verdict for the respondent.
A. The conclusion was that white personsâ€”it was a custom and usage not to serve white persons in the company of Negroes."  This evidence, although weakened by the cross-examination, was sufficient, I think, to require the court to let the case go to the jury and secure petitioner's constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial by that jury.
For the foregoing reasons I concur in the judgment reversing the Court of Appeals and remanding for a new trial on both counts
