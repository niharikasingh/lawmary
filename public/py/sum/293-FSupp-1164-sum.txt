Third party defendant Adams contends such service is not valid for the asserted reason that paragraph (f) of Rule 4 is  in conflict with and a limitation on the power to obtain service "in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held" as provided in Rule 4(d) (7).
The portion of the first sentence of Rule 4(f) which expressly provides that service may be made "beyond the territorial limits of that state * * * in which the district court is held * * * when authorized * * * by these rules" can not be ignored.
The first sentence of Rule 4(f), so far as the Western District of Missouri is concerned, permitted service of federal process in all portions of the State of Missouri outside this judicial district and, by its incorporation by reference of Rule 4(d) (7), also authorized valid service of process in accordance with all existing state procedures, including the new Missouri long-arm statute.
The 1963 Notes of the Advisory Committee make clear that the additional  service authorized by the 1963 amendment to Rule 4(f) was not intended to restrict or limit the service of either state or federal process authorized by any other portion of Rule 4.
The limitation notion suggested in Judge Maris' concurring opinion in McCoy was authoritatively laid to rest in Giffin v. Ensign, (3rd Cir. 1956) 234 F.2d 307, one of the cases approvingly cited in the Notes of the Advisory Committee. The court there stated that "the only question is whether a reasonable man must construe Rule 4(f) as so limiting Rule 4(d) (7) that it cannot apply to the situation of these nonresident defendants."
Both those cases upheld the validity of extraterritorial service made of third party complaints under state long-arm statutes free from any notion that Rule 4(f), either before or after the 1963 amendments of that rule, contained any limitation on the service obtained pursuant to state procedures as authorized by Rule 4(d) (7).
We incorporate what was there said in this opinion by this reference.
