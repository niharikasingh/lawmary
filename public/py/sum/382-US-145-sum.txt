In 1844 the Court reversed itself and ruled that a corporation was to be treated as a citizen of the State which created it.
In a compromise destined to endure for over a century,  the Court indulged in the fiction that, although a corporation was not itself a citizen for diversity purposes, its shareholders would conclusively be presumed citizens of the incorporating State.
In truth and in fact, they point out, many voluntary associations and labor unions are indistinguishable from corporations in terms of the reality    of function and structure, and to say that the latter are juridical persons and "citizens" and the former are not is to base a distinction upon an inadequate and irrelevant difference.
Accordingly, the Court held that the sociedad, Russell & Co., was a citizen domiciled in Puerto Rico, within the meaning of the Organic Act, and ordered the case remanded to the insular courts.
It should be noted that    the effect of Russell was to contract jurisdiction of the federal court in Puerto Rico.
Further, in contemplating a rule which would accommodate petitioner's claim, we are acutely aware of the complications arising from the circumstance that petitioner, like other labor unions, has local as well as national organizations and that these,   perhaps, should be reckoned with in connection with "citizenship" and its jurisdictional incidents.
Whether unincorporated labor unions ought to be assimilated to the status of corporations for diversity purposes, how such citizenship is to be determined, and what if any related rules ought to apply, are decisions which we believe suited to the legislative and not the judicial branch, regardless of our views as to the intrinsic merits of petitioner's argumentâ€”merits stoutly attested by widespread support for the recognition of labor unions as juridical personalities.
