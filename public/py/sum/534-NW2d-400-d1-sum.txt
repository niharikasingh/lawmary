The majority quotes with approval the general rule that whether money found is treasure trove, mislaid, abandoned, or lost property is a fact question. 1 Am.Jur.2d  Abandoned, Lost, and Unclaimed Property ยง 41, at 49 (2d ed. 1994).
After finding the money, Benjamin proceeded to give written notice of finding the property as prescribed in Iowa Code chapter 644 (1993), "Lost Property." As set out in section 556F.8, notices were posted on the courthouse door and in three other public places in the county.
Benjamin followed the law in giving legal notice of finding property.
No claim was made by the owner after legally prescribed notice was given that it had been found.
 I would hold that Benjamin is legally entitled to the entire amount of money that he found in the airplane wing as the owner of abandoned property
