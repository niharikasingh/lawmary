Custom, it is said, must have "the force of law"; and "law," as I read the opinion, is used in the Hamiltonian sense.  The Court requires state involvement in the enforcement of a "custom" before that "custom" can be actionable under 42 U. S. C. § 1983.
§ 4065. (1956) required "the entire executive branch of the government of the State of Mississippi...to prohibit by any lawful, peaceful, and constitutional means, the causing of a mixing or integration of the white and Negro races in public schools, public parks, public waiting rooms, public places of amusement, recreation or assembly in this state, by any branch of the federal government...." Every word and deed of a state officer, agent, or employee that was connected with maintaining segregated schools in Mississippi was deemed to be "the sovereign act...of the sovereign State of Mississippi."
The "under color of" provisions of § 1 of the 1871 Act, in turn, were derived from § 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat.
The meaning of "under color of...custom" in the context of the 1866 Act is therefore relevant to the meaning of that phrase as it is used in § 1983, for, as the Court states, the "under color of" provisions mean the same thing for § 1983 as they do for 18 U. S. C. § 242, the direct descendant of § 2 of the 1866 Act. Ante, at 152 n. 7.
Of course, § 2 of the 1866 Act did not cover purely private actions as did § 1 of the Act, and that was the point of our discussion of § 2 in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.
But the Court does not come to grips with the fact that actions taken "under color of any...custom" were covered by § 2 of the 1866 Act quite apart from  actions taken under "color of any statute, ordinance, [or] regulation"—in other words, quite apart from actions taken under "color of law" in the traditional sense.
And, despite the Court's suggestion to the contrary, the use of the term "under color of law" by the Court in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. was merely a shorthand reference for all the "under color of" provisions in § 2 and had no relevance to the specific problem of defining the meaning of "under color of...custom.
" Section 2, like § 1, involved in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., was bottomed on the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was enacted before the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.
If the wrong done to the individual was under "color" of "custom" alone, the ingredients of the cause of action were satisfied. The adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment  expanded the substantive rights covered by § 1 of the 1871 Act vis-à-vis those covered by § 2 of the 1866 Act.
Moreover, a majority of the Court held in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 761, 774, 782 and n. 6, that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment enables Congress to punish interferences with constitutional rights "whether or not state officers or others acting under the color of state law are implicated."
The reach of § 1983 is constitutional rights, including those under the Fourteenth Amendment; and Congress rightfully was concerned with their full protection, whoever might be the instigator or offender.
And, as I have said, the phrase "under color of any...custom" derives from § 2 of the 1866 Act which rested on the Thirteenth Amendment whose enforcement does not turn on "state action.
It is time we kept up with Congress and construed its laws in the full amplitude needed to rid their enforcement of the lingering tolerance for racial discrimination that we sanction today
