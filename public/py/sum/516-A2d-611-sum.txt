The Kapiloffs notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and that agency took physical possession of the stamps from J. & H. Stolow, another New York stamp dealer.
The stamps had been consigned to Stolow by Ganter, who asserted that they were his property.
When Ganter refused the Kapiloffs' demand that he return the stamps to them, they sued him and J. & H. Stolow, Inc., in replevin in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. The action was removed by Ganter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City where it was amended to include a count seeking a declaratory judgment that the Kapiloffs were "the true owners of the ... stamps."
Following a hearing, Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman entered summary judgment in favor of the Kapiloffs on both counts. The Replevin Action An action of replevin is designed to obtain possession of personal property that is wrongfully detained by the defendant.
Indubitably, the Kapiloffs had the right to assert an action in replevin since they averred that they owned the stamps and that Ganter and Stolow had unauthorized possession of the stamps when the action was filed.
The stamps were recovered by the F.B.I. from Stolow. Under what authority that federal agency took possession of the stamps is not clear.
"Finders Keepers" Having determined that the Kapiloffs could maintain an action of replevin and that the stamps were not in custodia legis, we turn now to Ganter's "FindersKeepers Theory" of ownership.
Another "dispute" advanced by Ganter is that the stamps may not be the same ones that the Kapiloffs own.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED
