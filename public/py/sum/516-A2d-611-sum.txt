In approximately 1976 they purchased two sets of stamps from Robert A. Siegel, Inc., a New York corporation dealing in postage stamps.
The Kapiloffs notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and that agency took physical possession of the stamps from J.
The stamps had been consigned to Stolow by Ganter, who asserted that they were his property.
The action was removed by Ganter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City where it was amended to include a count seeking a declaratory judgment that the Kapiloffs were "the true owners of the ...
Indubitably, the Kapiloffs had the right to assert an action in replevin since they averred that they owned the stamps and that Ganter and Stolow had unauthorized possession of the stamps when the action was filed.
The stamps were recovered by the F.B.I.
"Finders Keepers" Having determined that the Kapiloffs could maintain an action of replevin and that the stamps were not in custodia legis, we turn now to Ganter's "FindersKeepers Theory" of ownership.
We refer to but a few of them: To overcome the Kapiloffs' assertion of ownership, Ganter retorts that either of the brothers may have sold the stamps without the other's knowledge.
Ganter alleges that because he says he possessed the stamps for a few years there is an inference that he owned them.
Another "dispute" advanced by Ganter is that the stamps may not be the same ones that the Kapiloffs own.
That theory, while interesting, lacks support in the record, particularly when the Kapiloffs maintain that the particular stamps in question are theirs and an expert, Robert A. Siegel, who sold the stamps to the Kapiloffs, supports their claim of ownership.
Ganter hypothesizes that because the Kapiloffs failed to insure their stamp collection they were not the true owners.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED
