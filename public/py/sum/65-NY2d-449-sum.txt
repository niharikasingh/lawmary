First, it contends that the decision in Bichler should not be given collateral estoppel effect because (1) the cases do not raise identical issues, (2) there are indications that the Bichler verdict was based on jury compromise, (3) there are adjudications inconsistent with Bichler on each of the issues involved and (4) the Bichler decision is based on an unresolved and novel application of the law of concerted action not expressly adopted in New York.
The party seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel has the burden of demonstrating the identity of the issues in the present litigation and the prior determination, whereas the party attempting to defeat its application has the burden of establishing the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action (see, Ryan v New York Tel.
Applying these rules, we hold that collateral estoppel effect should be denied for the Bichler jury's finding on concerted action but that Lilly should be precluded from relitigating the five remaining issues relevant to this action and decided adversely to it in that trial (see, n 2, at p 455, supra).
We noted in a footnote that there were several theories upon which similar DES cases were proceeding or it had been suggested they might proceed but we expressed no view in Bichler and, express none now, on which of the proposed theories — concerted action, alternative liability, enterprise liability or market share liability — if any, should be adopted in this or similar DES cases (see, Bichler v Lilly & Co., supra, at p 580, n 5).
The point is significant because collateral estoppel effect will only be given to matters "actually litigated and determined" in a prior action (see, Restatement [Second] of Judgments   27, quoted in Koch v Consolidated Edison Co., 62 N.Y.2d 548, 554, n 2; see also, Ryan v New York Tel.
Because Lilly did not challenge the appropriateness of the concerted action theory in Bichler, it was not actually litigated and there is no identity between that issue in Bichler and here.
Although indications of jury compromise is one factor properly to be considered in determining whether a party against whom collateral estoppel is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in the prior determination (see, Koch v Consolidated Edison Co., 62 N.Y.2d 548, 555, n 4, supra, quoting Schwartz v Public Administrator, 24 N.Y.2d 65, 72, supra), the evidence offered to defeat application of the doctrine in this case is insufficient.
Finally, although adjudications on the same issue inconsistent with the one to be given preclusive effect are relevant evidence that the party contesting estoppel did not have a fair opportunity to litigate the prior determination and may be a factor in refusing to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel (see, id., at p 555, and n 4, quoting Restatement [Second] of Judgments  ), the cases relied on by Lilly do not support that result here.
Those cited include generally cases in which the jury returned a verdict for Lilly on a failure to warn theory  and    others in which the court granted Lilly judgment either because concerted action was an inappropriate legal theory for DES litigation or because the evidence was insufficient to raise a factual issue on concerted action.
