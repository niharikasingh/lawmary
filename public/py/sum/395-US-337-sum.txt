She nonetheless claims that the Wisconsin garnishment procedure violates that due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment, in that notice and an opportunity to be heard are not given before the in rem seizure of the wages.
What happens in Wisconsin is that the clerk of the court issues the summons at the request of the creditor's lawyer; and it is the latter who by serving the garnishee sets in motion the machinery whereby the    wages are frozen.
In this case the sole question is whether there has been a taking of property without that procedural due process that is required by the Fourteenth Amendment.
We have dealt over and over again with the question of what constitutes "the right to be heard" (Schroeder v. New York, 371 U.S. 208, 212) within the meaning of procedural due process.
In the context of this case the question is whether the interim freezing of the wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.
The result is that a prejudgment garnishment of the Wisconsin type may as a practical matter drive a wage- earning    family to the wall.
