Id. Thus, we must determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact after drawing any inferences in the light most favorable to Houchens. III. Section 64.1-105 of the Virginia Code  provides that a person who has been missing for 7 years is presumed to be dead.
Therefore, the burden is on Mrs. Houchens to prove that her husband died by accidental means.
We elaborated on that standard in Helm v. Western Maryland Ry. Co.: The appellate court, therefore, must reverse the grant of summary judgment if it appears from the record that there is an unresolved issue of material fact; the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the materials before the trial court must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
  838 F.2d 729, 734 (4th Cir.1988). On this appeal, then, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Houchens to ascertain whether she made a sufficient showing that Mr. Houchens died accidentally.
The court explained the issue as follows: Defendant contends that because of the two-fold nature of the ultimate fact — both of which are dependent upon circumstantial evidence — the jury was first asked to infer death from the proven facts and thereafter to infer the manner of death — and that this process constitutes "the piling of inferences upon inferences."
The Martin court was persuaded that the surrounding circumstances of the missing person's disappearance gave rise to two separate inferences: (1) that he was dead; and (2) that the death was caused by accident.
The other two cases Houchens relies upon have equally bizarre and telling circumstances surrounding the disappearances.
The court held that an inference of accidental death could be drawn from the circumstances surrounding his disappearance: We are not unmindful of [the rule] that "if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred."
  The circumstances surrounding his disappearance do not give us a clue that he actually died, as did the circumstances in Martin, Englehart, and Valley National. Viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Houchens, we can only conclude that Mr. Houchens disappeared, and then presume that he died under Virginia law.
As the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia has noted: It is the settled doctrine in Virginia, supported by a long line of decisions, that where circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish suicide as a defense to an action on a life insurance policy, the law presumes that death results from a natural cause and the burden is upon the insurer to establish suicide by clear and satisfactory evidence to the exclusion of any reasonable hypothesis consistent with death from natural or accidental causes.
The only question for the court in those cases was whether the death was an accident or a suicide.
