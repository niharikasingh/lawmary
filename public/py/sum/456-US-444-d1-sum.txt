The question before the Court is whether the notice provided by Kentucky's statute meets this standard.
The weight of historical precedent is reinforced by the collective wisdom of the legislatures of the at least 11 States authorizing notice in summary eviction proceedings solely by posting or by leaving the notice at the tenant's residence. The Court itself acknowledges that "posting notice on the door of a person's home would, in many or perhaps most instances, constitute.
The Court nonetheless rejects these established procedures as unconstitutional, though it does not cite a single case, other than the decision below, supporting its position that notice by posting is constitutionally inadequate in summary eviction proceedings.
The Court neglects to mention,  however, that another process server, Mr. Gilbert Brutscher, cast doubt on Mr. Bacon's testimony by stating: "I had been warned beforehand that, by Mr. Bacon, Carter Bacon, that he suspected â€” he wasn't certain, but he suspected that on some occasions the Writs had been torn off the doors by kids.
The Court also neglects to mention that another process server testified that in order to avoid problems with children, the process servers "always put [the writs] up high.
Plainly, such conflicting testimony falls well short of what this Court should require before rushing to scrap Kentucky's considered legislative judgment that, as a last resort, posted notice is an appropriate form of service of process for forcible entry and detainer actions.
The Court, however, holds that notice via the mails is so far superior to posted notice that the difference is of constitutional dimension. How the Court reaches this judgment remains  a mystery, especially since the Court is unable, on the present record, to evaluate the risks that notice mailed to public housing projects might fail due to loss, misdelivery, lengthy delay, or theft.
