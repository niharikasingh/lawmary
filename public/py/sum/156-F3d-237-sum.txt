MONY appeals from the court's dismissal of its counterclaim for restitution of money that Iglesias obtained by submitting admittedly overstated expense reports.
We affirm the judgment for MONY against Iglesias. We vacate the order dismissing MONY's counterclaim and remand the counterclaim with directions to dismiss the counterclaim without prejudice for want of jurisdiction.
To interpret this contract provision so as to grant each of those agents the power to control which products MONY offers within that particular agent's jurisdiction would give Iglesias and other agents the power to veto policy decisions made by MONY's upper management at the company's national headquarters.
Second, MONY attempted to raise the falsified expense requests as an affirmative defense to Iglesias's discrimination claims, arguing that they provided MONY with a valid nondiscriminatory reason to terminate Iglesias. The court did not allow MONY to pursue this strategy because MONY learned of these improprieties only after it had terminated Iglesias. Third, and more importantly for our purposes, MONY sought leave to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for restitution.
Since MONY's counterclaim sounds in state law, a federal court may not hear it unless it falls within the ambit of supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an independent jurisdictional basis.
See Toste Farm Corp. v. Hadbury, Inc., 70 F.3d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that a federal court has jurisdiction over a counterclaim only if it resides within the court's supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an independent jurisdictional basis).
The parties appear to have assumed that MONY's counterclaim was within the court's supplemental jurisdiction.
The evidence relevant to these claims includes the terms of Iglesias's employment contract and documentary, testimonial or other evidence concerning MONY's actions in Puerto Rico. By contrast, MONY's counterclaim is for restitution of monies that Iglesias wrongfully obtained from the company over the period from 1981 to 1988.
We conclude that MONY's counterclaim is permissive rather than compulsory, and is not supported by federal supplemental jurisdiction.
In these circumstances — lacking MONY's allegation that the counterclaim meets the jurisdictional amount, and lacking facts of record indicative that this is so — we must conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to proceed.
In these circumstances, the dismissal we now order shall be without prejudice to MONY's right, if it can do so in good faith, to amend the counterclaim within such time as the district court allows so as to allege a supportably proper jurisdictional amount. If MONY can do so, the district court may lift the jurisdictional bar.
