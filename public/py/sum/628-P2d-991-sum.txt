At issue on this appeal from a suit brought to recover "double indemnity" insurance benefits is the propriety of a grant of summary judgment in favor of J.C. Penney Insurance Company, Guardsman Life Insurance Company and Old Republic Life Insurance Company (appellees) against the Valley National Bank of Arizona, as personal representative of the estate of Sharon G. Seay (appellant).
Seay's   Guardsman policy is similar in its requirement that accidental death benefits will be paid if the insured's death is the result of accidental bodily injury independent of other causes.
As was stated in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Greber, 55 Ariz. 261, 100 P.2d 987 (1940): When double indemnity is claimed for an accidental death under a policy like that involved herein, it is incumbent upon the beneficiary to establish affirmatively and by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence that the death of the insured resulted from the specific cause of death set forth in the double indemnity clause.
Rather, they argue that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment since appellant failed to present any evidence whatsoever that Seay's death resulted from accidental rather than natural causes.
In support of this argument they point out that the only evidence brought forward by appellant was that Frank Seay was in good health when he left for Mexico. They contend, however, that this evidence was too remote in time to be of any use, since it consisted of medical reports dated approximately three years prior to his death, and further, that such evidence would be insufficient to raise an inference in any event.
It is true that the Guardsman policy requires evidence of visible contusions or wounds on the exterior of the body, but we hold that this provision is non-exclusive, since it does not preclude proof of accidental death by other means.
Appellant, in support of its position that the evidence here clearly raises an inference of accidental death, refers us to cases from other states where circumstantial evidence was found to support a jury verdict of death by accidental means.
The appeals court first noted that: The ultimate fact which plaintiff had the burden of proving was the accidental death of Wagner M. Robinson, Jr. Because his body has never been found, such proof was necessarily limited to circumstantial evidence. 1 Wash. App. at 221, 460 P.2d at 684.
