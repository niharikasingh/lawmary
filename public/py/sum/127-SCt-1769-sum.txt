On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision to allow respondent's Fourth Amendment claim against Scott to proceed to trial. Taking respondent's view of the facts as given, the Court of Appeals concluded that Scott's actions could constitute "deadly force" under Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), and that the use of such force in this context "would violate [respondent's] constitutional right to be free from excessive force during a seizure.
Saucier, supra, at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. We therefore turn to the threshold inquiry: whether Deputy Scott's actions violated the Fourth Amendment. III A The first step in assessing the constitutionality of Scott's actions is to determine the relevant facts.
The videotape quite clearly contradicts the version of the story told by respondent and adopted by the Court of Appeals. For example, the Court of Appeals adopted respondent's assertions that, during the chase, "there was little, if any, actual threat to pedestrians or other motorists, as the roads were mostly empty and [respondent] remained in control of his vehicle." 433 F.3d, at 815.
Far from being the cautious and controlled driver the lower court depicts, what we see on the video more closely resembles a Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening  sort, placing police officers and innocent bystanders alike at great risk of serious injury. At the summary judgment stage, facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a "genuine" dispute as to those facts.
B Judging the matter on that basis, we think it is quite clear that Deputy Scott did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Scott does not contest that his decision to terminate the car chase by ramming his bumper into respondent's vehicle constituted a "seizure."
The question we need to answer is whether Scott's actions were objectively reasonable.  1 Respondent urges us to analyze this case as we analyzed Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1.
If so, respondent claims that Garner prescribes certain preconditions that must be met before Scott's actions can survive Fourth Amendment scrutiny: (1) The suspect must have posed an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others; (2) deadly force must have been necessary to prevent escape; and (3) where feasible, the officer must have given the suspect some warning.
Thus, in judging whether Scott's actions were reasonable, we must consider the risk of bodily harm that Scott's actions posed to respondent in light of the threat to the public that Scott was trying to eliminate.
It is equally clear that Scott's actions posed a high likelihood of serious injury or death to respondentâ€”though not the near certainty of death posed by, say, shooting a fleeing felon in the back of the head, see Garner, supra, at 4, 105 S.Ct. 1694, or pulling alongside a fleeing motorist's car and shooting the motorist, cf.
Instead, we lay down a more sensible rule: A police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.
* * * The car chase that respondent initiated in this case posed a substantial and immediate risk of serious physical injury to others; no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.
The Court of Appeals' decision to the contrary is reversed.
