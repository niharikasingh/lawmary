The logs in question were found by plaintiff floating in the Delaware bay after a great freshet, were taken up and moored with ropes in the mouth of Mispillion creek.
(2 Saund. Plead. Evid. 879; 1 Strange 505, Armory vs. Delamirie; 2 Leigh's Nisi Prius 1474-5-6; 1 Chitty Pl 151.)
The defence consists, not in showing that the defendants are the rightful owners, or claim under the rightful owner; but that the logs were found by them adrift in Mispillion creek, having been loosened from their fastening either by accident or design, and they insist that their title is as good as that of the plaintiff.
But it is a well settled rule of law that the loss of a chattel does not change the light of property; and for the same reason that the original loss of these logs by the rightful owner, did not change his absolute property in them, but he might have maintained trover against the plaintiff upon refusal to deliver them, so the subsequent loss did not divest the special property of the plaintiff.
Verdict for the plaintiff
