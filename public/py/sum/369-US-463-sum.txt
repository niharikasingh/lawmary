These two corporate defendants then appeared in the New York District Court and moved to have the case dismissed by that court on the ground that the Pennsylvania District Court had not had personal jurisdiction over them and, lacking such personal jurisdiction, it had not had power under ยง 1406 (a) to transfer the  action. The New York District Court granted this motion on the ground asserted, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, with Judge Hincks dissenting, affirmed on the same ground. Because this decision presented a conflict with the uniform course of decisions previously made on this same question by other Courts of Appeal, we granted certiorari. Section 1406 (a), under which the Pennsylvania District Court transferred this case, provides: "The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought."
Indeed, this case is itself a typical example of the problem sought to be avoided, for dismissal here would have resulted in plaintiff's losing a substantial part of its cause of action under the statute of limitations merely because it made a mistake in thinking that the respondent corporations could be "found" or that they "transact...business" in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The language and history of ยง 1406 (a), both as originally enacted and as amended in 1949, show a congressional purpose to provide as effective a remedy as possible to avoid precisely this sort of injustice.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly Reversed
