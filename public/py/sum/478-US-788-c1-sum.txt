The Court also correctly refuses to fashion a federal common-law rule of preclusion that would bar respondent from litigating his claim against the University under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In Part IV of its opinion, however, the Court concludes that the findings of the administrative assistant may bar respondent's claims under 42 U. S. C.   1983 and other of the Reconstruction-era Civil Rights Acts.
1   Nor does preclusion show respect for  U.S. 801]  state administrative determinations, because litigants apprised of this decision will presumably forgo state administrative determinations for the same reason they currently forgo state judicial review of those determinations â€” to protect their entitlement to a federal forum.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part IV of the Court's opinion
