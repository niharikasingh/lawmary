Alleging that their union, the NHL Players Association ("NHLPA"), was co-opted by the NHL and pilfered by their own union leader for nearly two decades, plaintiffs bring this suit as a putative class action on behalf of all players employed by NHL teams between 1972 and 1991 against R. Alan Eagleson, former executive director of the NHLPA; several businesses owned or controlled by Eagleson, Jialson Holdings, Ltd., Sports Management, Ltd., Rae-Con Consultants, Ltd., and Eagleson, Ungerman, a law firm (the "Canadian defendants"); and the NHL, its Member Clubs, and two NHL officials, John Ziegler, President of the NHL from 1977 to 1992, and William W. Wirtz, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the NHL (the "NHL defendants").
The NHL defendants and Eagleson have moved to dismiss or for summary judgment as to Count I on grounds that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
Keystone established both a general discovery accrual rule and a "last predicate act" exception as follows: [T]he limitations period for a civil RICO claim runs from the date the plaintiff knew or should have know that the elements of a civil RICO cause of action existed unless, as a part of the same pattern of racketeering activity, there is further injury to the plaintiff or further predicate acts occur, in which case the accrual period shall run from the time when the plaintiff knew or *357 should have known of the last injury or the last predicate act which is part of the same pattern of racketeering activity.
The Court did not, however, purport to disturb Keystone's general rule (also known as the "injury plus source plus pattern" discovery rule) that the statute of limitations period for a civil RICO claim "runs from the date the plaintiff knew or should have know that the elements of a civil RICO cause of action existed."
 With these principles in mind, I turn to plaintiffs' allegations and the evidence defendants contend shows that plaintiffs had or should have had notice of their claim prior to November 7, 1991.
Plaintiffs allege that from 1976 through 1991 the NHL defendants gave Eagleson unsupervised control of a joint NHL-NHLPA venture which participated in international hockey tournaments.
In fact, plaintiffs allege, with Eagleson's assent the NHL defendants simply reduced their contributions to the pension fund by however much the players contributed through international hockey.
The crux of plaintiffs' claim against the NHL defendants is that they knew that Eagleson was using his control of international hockey and NHL disability insurance funds to enrich himself, but nonetheless allowed him to continue to exercise these powers unconstrained.
Plaintiffs allege that the NHL defendants violated ง 302(a) each time they permitted NHL players to participate in an international tournament, gave Eagleson unsupervised control over a tournament and its revenues, failed to hold Eagleson accountable for the revenues and/or overlooked his financial improprieties, and allowed him control over placement of the NHL's disability insurance premiums.
As evidence that plaintiffs had or should have had knowledge of their cause of action by September 1991, at the latest, defendants point to a 1984 Sports Illustrated expose of Eagleson; a 1989 report on Eagleson's stewardship *361 of the union (the "Garvey report") issued by investigators acting at the behest of a large number of hockey players; a complaint filed on behalf of two players with the Alberta Labor Relations Board in June 1991 seeking to void the players' collective bargaining agreement on grounds of collusion between the union and the NHL; and a series of investigative articles on the NHL and the union published in September 1991 by The Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Massachusetts.
The Sports Illustrated article, published in July 1984 and entitled "The Man Who Rules Hockey," began with these assertions, among others: From an unshakable power base rooted in 17 years of near-dictatorial rule as executive director of the NHL Players' Association, and fueled by what one associate calls "an ego the size of Guatemala," Eagleson, 51, has spread his personal and corporate influence from his Toronto offices into virtually every aspect of hockey in which there's a dollar to be made.
In addition to evidence of a pattern of self-dealing in his representation and financial counseling of individual player-clients, the article reported that Eagleson apparently enriched himself in administering international hockey and players' disability insurance funds.
at 66-69) As to international hockey, the article alluded to a possible collusive link between Eagleson's control of the tournaments and his representation of the players in bargaining with the NHL as follows: [U]nlike their football, baseball and basketball counterparts, hockey players have never seriously threatened to strike.
 In November 1988, they "issued a `Position Paper' to the public in which, inter alia, they questioned Eagleson's conflicts as union leader and player agent as well as his role in international hockey," contended that it was his fiduciary duty to disclose information on the tournaments' finances, and asserted that "[a]udited information should have been prepared regarding all monies received by Mr. Eagleson directly, or indirectly, in relation to his efforts in organizing the international hockey events."
A. at 1.)
Among the conflicts of interest with which the report took issue was Eagleson's simultaneous control over international hockey and collective bargaining negotiations with the NHL: International Hockey vs. NHLPA Interests: A general manager was quoted by SI as follows: `Al delivers us the players and we give him international hockey.
) In response to the Garvey report and other public criticism of his leadership, Eagleson sent several memos and newsletters to all players asserting that he had never received benefits from international hockey, direct or indirect; that Hockey Canada's tournament records were audited and approved by independent accountants; and that financial statements were available.
In addition to these misrepresentations and continued refusals to disclose financial information, plaintiffs allege, "Eagleson and representatives of the Member Clubs repeatedly misled members of the class [of hockey players] by asserting that allegations that players had received less than adequate benefits over the years were not true," while Eagleson "made numerous other statements to the players, purporting to document why concerns raised by Garvey and others were not accurate or well founded."
The complaint alleged that the union was dominated by the NHL as the result of an arrangement between Eagleson and the NHL and certain Member Clubs and officials and leveled a host of charges of collusion between Eagleson and the NHL, centered in large part on the NHL's acquiescence in Eagleson's use of international hockey to enrich himself and his family and associates.
โ" While representing more than 2,500 players since 1967 on teams in the United States and Canada, the players' union is not fully accountable to labor authorities in either nation..... โ" Eagleson became Canada's international hockey czar by obtaining the blessing of NHL owners, with whom he has bargained on behalf of the players.
As to the conflict of interest presented by Eagleson's control of international hockey, one article stated: *367 Eagleson's biggest conflict, according to critics, stems from his maintaining personal and professional ties to NHL bosses while also representing players as their union's executive director.....   Eagleson is also linked to NHL owners and executives through international hockey.... Eagleson needed NHL approval to use NHL players in that [first Canada Cup] match and all that he has organized since then.
In one such memo to the union's then-deputy chief, Bob Goodenow, Winter sought information about and demanded the union investigate, inter alia, Sports Illustrated charges that Eagleson had pocketed money paid by international hockey for the services of his employees, maintained questionable financial ties to Arthur Harnett's companies, and charged illegitimate fees to players seeking disability insurance.
In addition to these statements, each plaintiff states generally he did not and could not have known that Eagleson was illegitimately skimming profits from international hockey and taking bribes from the NHL defendants prior to the 1994 indictment.
 Specifically, each contends he learned for the first time from the indictment that Eagleson was (1) secretly receiving money from the sale of advertising rights by the companies of Arthur Harnett, Irvin Ungerman, and other associates; (2) appropriating air travel passes given by Air Canada as payment for advertising rights; and (3) charging international hockey for excessive, illegitimate out-of-pocket expenses.
 With the exception of Forbes and Park (who inquired of the author of The Eagle-Tribune series and found out Eagleson was being investigated by the U.S. government), plaintiffs do not state whether they inquired into general allegations that Eagleson had serious conflicts of interest that might have lead him to betray the players' interest.
 None of the plaintiffs states whether he was aware of specific allegations that Eagleson had charged illegitimate fees or derived other benefits from his control of disability insurance, subsidized his private businesses' expenses with international tournament money, or directed control over tourney advertising rights to close business associates.
Plaintiffs argue they were stymied from learning all the facts essential to their claim despite more than reasonably diligent attempts to do so because defendants failed *370 to disclose and misrepresented financial documentation that would have informed plaintiffs of their claim.
Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged that in November 1988 some player agents issued a paper "to the public" questioning Eagleson's conflicts of interest, inter alia, as head of international hockey; that between 1989 and early 1991 Eagleson sent mailings to all players โ" current and retired โ" specifically referring to and defending himself against the allegations of Sports Illustrated, Garvey, and Rich Winter (see also Forbes Aff.
Thus, by early 1991 at the latest all plaintiffs knew or should have known of allegations that Eagleson had serious conflicts of interest and inadequately represented the players, and all either had learned of or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have inquired into the allegations in the Garvey and Sports Illustrated reports.
Thus, by early 1991 at the latest all plaintiffs knew or should have known of allegations that Eagleson had serious conflicts of interest and inadequately represented the players, and all either had learned of or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have inquired into the allegations in the Garvey and Sports Illustrated reports.
Even the most cursory of perusals of any one of these three publications would have revealed to plaintiffs the gist of their claim: Eagleson was enriching himself by means of international hockey and the disability insurance and the NHL defendants knew so but apparently took no action to remove those *371 opportunities from him.
Moreover, examination of either the Sports Illustrated or The Eagle-Tribune article would have revealed almost every detail of the schemes plaintiffs now allege in their complaint, as well as sources to whom they could have gone for verification or further information.
The NHL defendants knew or should have known, if only from the same public allegations of which plaintiffs were aware, of charges that Eagleson's control over international hockey was a conflict of interest and, more specifically, that Eagleson was enriching himself and his associates by means of international hockey.
These facts were more than sufficient to provide plaintiffs with notice that the NHL defendants might be turning a blind eye to Eagleson's use of international hockey and NHL disability insurance funds to enrich himself, and thus with notice of a claim that both the NHL defendants and Eagleson were continuously violating ง 302 of LMRA.
C. In contending that they lacked actual or constructive notice of their claim prior to Eagleson's indictment in 1994, plaintiffs do not argue that they were unaware of facts showing the alleged "pattern" element of their cause of action and do not seriously argue they were unaware of their possible injuries.
They contend that no matter how carefully examined the information available to them did not give notice of two facts essential to recognizing that defendants' conduct constituted such violations: that (1) the revenues Eagleson appropriated from international hockey tournaments were "illegitimate"; and (2) a portion of those revenues rightfully belonged to the NHL defendants.
As to ง 302(c) (1), plaintiffs have neither alleged nor argued that Eagleson was or appeared to be an "employee" or "former employee" of the NHL with regard to his international tournament organizing, and it is clear on this record that they could not do so in good faith.
Plaintiffs next assert that they had to know that a substantial portion of the international tournament revenues Eagleson was misappropriating rightfully belonged to the NHL defendants before they could know that the NHL defendants had violated ง 302.
 According to plaintiffs' own theory, even if Eagleson were enriching himself only at the expense of third parties rather than with NHL funds, both he and the NHL defendants were nonetheless in violation of ง 302.
) *374 Moreover, plaintiffs do not explain what information available to them only after November 1991 finally lead them to learn that Eagleson must have been taking NHL money.
The indictment provides no information in this regard not already apparent from the international hockey profit-sharing agreement between the NHL and the NHLPA enshrined in their collective bargaining agreements beginning in 1976.
Plaintiffs also assert that some of Eagleson's schemes remained wholly hidden and could not have been uncovered until the 1994 indictment, citing Eagleson's appropriation of thousands of dollars worth of travel passes and other in-kind benefits paid by Air Canada and other businesses in exchange for international tournament advertising rights, and his pocketing of proceeds from the sale of Canada Cup advertising rights between 1984 and 1991 by All Canada Sports Promotions, Ltd., the firm owned by a close associate, Irvin Ungerman, to which Eagleson gave control of advertising rights.
The gravamen of plaintiffs' claim is a collusive arrangement between Eagleson and the NHL defendants that resulted in collective bargaining agreements disadvantageous to the players.
Knowing every way in which Eagleson used international hockey to enrich himself was unnecessary for plaintiffs to have notice that defendants had maintained such an arrangement in continuous violation of ง 302.
In fact, even without the benefit of further investigation during the limitations period, plaintiffs could have plead all but two of their allegations concerning Eagleson's self-enriching schemes โ" neither of them essential to their claim (see Comp.
D. Since plaintiffs had notice of all the elements of their claim prior to November 1991, any claims for injuries incurred before that date are barred unless the statute of limitations was tolled because defendants affirmatively mislead them as to the nature or significance of those facts so as to prevent plaintiffs from recognizing their cause of action.
The only alleged acts of concealment of a potentially misleading nature were Eagleson's claims that independent audits by outside accounting firms had verified that the finances of international hockey and the NHLPA were in order.
Naked representations that international hockey finances were audited and in order could not, for example, negate the claims of several former Eagleson employees and Eagleson's own admission that he had subsidized the salaries of his private employees with international hockey money, or undo Eagleson's admission that he gave control of Canada Cup advertising rights to a close associate whom various other sources claimed he controlled, or obscure insurance brokers' and players' claims that he had used his control over disability insurance to extort legal fees and other personal benefits from them.
To summarize, I find (1) it is undisputed and indisputable that plaintiffs had inquiry notice of their claim by 1990 at the latest; (2) in the exercise of reasonable diligence plaintiffs should at the very least have inquired into the specific factual allegations in the Garvey and Sports Illustrated reports; (3) these reports, as well as The Eagle-Tribune articles read by two plaintiffs, provided notice to plaintiffs by October 1991 at the latest of more than sufficient facts to show the existence of their claim that the NHL defendants and Eagleson had engaged in a pattern of ง 302 violations resulting in inadequate representation and bad deals for the players; and (4) no reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs were mislead as to their cause of action so as to toll the statute of limitations.
The statute of limitations does not bar claims for any "new and independent injuries" incurred by plaintiffs after November 7, 1991 as a result of defendants' alleged racketeering activity.
ORDER AND NOW this 27th day of August, 1998, upon consideration of defendants' motions to dismiss or for summary judgment and the parties' filings related thereto, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that: (1) The motion of the NHL defendants as to Count I of plaintiffs' complaint is GRANTED in its entirety: (a) judgment is entered in favor of defendants National Hockey League (NHL), the NHL Member Clubs, John Ziegler, William W. Wirtz, and R. Alan Eagleson and against plaintiffs David S. Forbes, Richard D. Middleton, D. Bradford Park, Ulf Nilsson, and Douglas D. Smail as to plaintiffs' claims for injuries incurred prior to November 7, 1991; and (b) plaintiffs' claims against these same defendants for injuries incurred on or after November 7, 1991 are dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
(3) If plaintiffs wish to seek certification of this Order pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure they should so move by September 30, 1998
