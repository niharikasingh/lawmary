The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that petitioner's real property has been rendered valueless by the State's regulation.
The finding of no value must be considered under the Takings Clause by reference to the owner's reasonable, investment-backed expectations.
The Takings Clause, while conferring substantial protection on property owners, does not eliminate the police power of the State to enact limitations on the use of their property.
The State should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to changing conditions, and courts must consider all reasonable expectations whatever their source.
The Takings Clause does not require a static body of state property law; it protects private expectations to ensure private investment.
The Supreme Court of South Carolina erred, in my view, by reciting the general purposes for which the state regulations were enacted without a determination that they were in accord with the owner's reasonable expectations, and therefore sufficient to support a severe restriction on specific parcels of property.
With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court
