The trial court directed verdicts in favor of the defendants on the claim for wanton conduct.
The only issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting directed verdicts on the wantonness claim in favor of defendants Fred Gant, the plant manager; John Turner, the personnel manager; and Richard Fleming, the supervisor of the fabrication department.
In Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Ford, 406 So.2d 854, at 856 (Ala.1981), this Court stated the standard of review for a directed verdict: "A directed verdict is proper only where there is a complete absence of  proof on an issue material to the claim or where there are no disputed questions of fact on which reasonable people could differ.
In considering a motion for directed verdict, the court must apply Rule 50(e), ARCP, under which `a question must go to the jury, if the evidence, or any reasonable inference arising therefrom, furnishes a mere gleam, glimmer, spark ... or a scintilla in support of the theory of the complaint....' Dixie Electric Company v. Maggio, 294 Ala. 411, 318 So.2d 274 (Ala.1975).
The trial court's judgment based on the directed verdicts as to Turner, Gant, and Fleming is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial on the plaintiffs' claim for wanton conduct
