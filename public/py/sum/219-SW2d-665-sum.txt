Plaintiffs sued Biegel, in replevin, for possession of an ancient Indian canoe found embedded in land owned by Mrs. Evans, intervenor.
The new channel ran through land formerly owned by one Haney, who died many years ago.
Plaintiffs claim the canoe, by right of discovery of lost or abandoned property, and on the theory that it is personal property which Mrs. Haney may claim under her rights as widow of the former owner.
Therefore, the court could only have found, from the evidence, that the canoe was once the personal property of persons unknown, and that it was, by the forces of nature alone, embedded in the soil of land now owned by intervenor.
It is the English case of Elwes v. Briggs Gas Company, 33 Ch.
It was said that the original owners were long since dead, that it is inconceivable that their title could be established, and that the owner of the land claimed not only the surface thereof but everything within the soil, to the center of the earth, including the ship that was embedded therein.
It was applied in the case of Ferguson v. Ray, supra, where gold bearing quartz which had been left, at the location where found, by human agency, and when found was partially *Page 823 buried in the soil.
The judgment should be affirmed
