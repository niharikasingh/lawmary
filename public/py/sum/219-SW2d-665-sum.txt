Plaintiffs sued Biegel, in replevin, for possession of an ancient Indian canoe found embedded in land owned by Mrs. Evans, intervenor.
Therefore, the court could only have found, from the evidence, that the canoe was once the personal property of persons unknown, and that it was, by the forces of nature alone, embedded in the soil of land now owned by intervenor.
It is the English case of Elwes v. Briggs Gas Company, 33 Ch. 562, where an ancient ship, some 2000 years old, hollowed out of a single oak log and retaining its character of wood (not fossilized), was discovered, embedded in the soil, by the lessee of the land, while lawfully excavating thereon.
It was said that the original owners were long since dead, that it is inconceivable that their title could be established, and that the owner of the land claimed not only the surface thereof but everything within the soil, to the center of the earth, including the ship that was embedded therein.
Plaintiffs claim some rights, by assignment, under the widow of Mr. Haney. Since the canoe was a part of the realty, prior to its severance, the life tenant had no right to sever it.
The judgment should be affirmed
