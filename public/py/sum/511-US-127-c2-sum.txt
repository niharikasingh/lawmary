I am in full agreement with the Court that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits gender discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), for example, the Court invalidated a West Virginia law prohibiting blacks from serving on juries.
The Equal Protection Clause and our constitutional tradition are based on the theory that an individual possesses rights that are protected against lawless action by the government.
The neutral phrasing of the Equal Protection Clause, extending its guarantee to "any person," reveals its concern with rights of individuals, not groups (though group disabilities are sometimes the mechanism by which the State violates the individual right in question).
* * * For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court holding that peremptory strikes based on gender violate the Equal Protection Clause
