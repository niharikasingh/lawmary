I am in full agreement with the Court that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits gender discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
In recognition of the evident historical fact that the Equal Protection Clause was adopted to prohibit government discrimination on the basis of race, the Court most often interpreted it in the decades that followed in accord with that purpose.
In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), for example, the Court invalidated a West Virginia law prohibiting blacks from serving on juries.
For purposes of the Equal Protection Clause, an individual denied jury service because of a peremptory challenge exercised against her on account of her sex is no less injured than the individual denied jury service because of a law banning members of her sex from serving as jurors.
* * * For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court holding that peremptory strikes based on gender violate the Equal Protection Clause
