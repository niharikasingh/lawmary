The complaint alleges that the newspaper published by the defendant is the only general daily newspaper in Poughkeepsie and is known as the "Poughkeepsie New Yorker," and that, by reason of its large circulation and high reputation, it is "the dominant advertising medium in the entire area of its publication."
It is further alleged that the defendant refuses, because of the persuasion and coercion of local merchants in competition with plaintiff, to publish advertising of the plaintiff in the defendant's newspaper and that, as a result, the plaintiff's business has been seriously reduced and such refusal has caused and will continue to cause irreparable damage to plaintiff's business.
The holding of courts in other States is summarized in a note in volume 87 of American Law Reports at page 979 as follows: â€” "With the exception of one case, Uhlman v. Sherman (1919) 22 Ohio N. P. N. S. 225, 31 Ohio Dec. N. P. 54 * * *, it has been uniformly held in the few cases which have considered the question that the business of publishing a newspaper is a strictly private enterprise, as distinguished from a business affected with a public interest, and that its publisher is under no legal obligation to sell advertising to all who may apply for The plaintiff contends that this court should reject the majority view and adopt the reasoning laid down by the Ohio decision [205 Misc.
This court holds, therefore, that, in this State, the newspaper business is in the nature of a private enterprise and that, in the absence of valid statutory regulation to the contrary, the publishers of a newspaper have the general right either to publish or reject a commercial advertisement tendered to them.
The complaint is dismissed.
