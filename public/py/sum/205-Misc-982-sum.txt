The holding of courts in other States is summarized in a note in volume 87 of American Law Reports at page 979 as follows: â€” "With the exception of one case, Uhlman v. Sherman (1919) 22 Ohio N. P. N. S. 225, 31 Ohio Dec. N. P. 54 * * *, it has been uniformly held in the few cases which have considered the question that the business of publishing a newspaper is a strictly private enterprise, as distinguished from a business affected with a public interest, and that its publisher is under no legal obligation to sell advertising to all who may apply for The plaintiff contends that this court should reject the majority view and adopt the reasoning laid down by the Ohio decision  of Uhlman v. Sherman (supra).
And there are no pertinent statutory regulations in this State. It may be  that the Legislature has the right to reasonably regulate the newspaper advertising business but the fact that it has not seen fit to do so does not confer power upon the courts to impose rules for the conduct of such business.
This court holds, therefore, that, in this State, the newspaper business is in the nature of a private enterprise and that, in the absence of valid statutory regulation to the contrary, the publishers of a newspaper have the general right either to publish or reject a commercial advertisement tendered to them.
The complaint is dismissed.
