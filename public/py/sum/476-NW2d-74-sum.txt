The trial court sustained defendant's motion for summary judgment on the basis of Iowa Code section 614.1(2) (1989) (two-year statute of limitations for personal injury suits).
The court determined that the claim was time barred because it was filed more than two years after the diagnosis of asbestosis.
The district court reasoned that the statute of limitations began to run when Wilber became aware of an asbestos-related injury on January 31, 1984.
The trial court placed considerable reliance on our holding in LeBeau v. Dimig, 446 N.W.2d 800 (Iowa 1989).
Id. (quoting Albertson v. T.J. Stevenson & Co., 749 F.2d 223, 230 (5th Cir.1984)). The plaintiff realizes that an injury has occurred  and its cause, but the full extent of the harm has not become manifest.
Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 684 F.2d 111, 120-21 (D.C.Cir.1982) (earlier diagnosis of mild asbestosis did not cause claim for mesothelioma attributable to same asbestos exposure to be time barred).
Sheppard v. A.C. & S. Co., 498 A.2d 1126, 1134 (Del.Super.Ct.1985) (earlier diagnosis of pleural thickening did not time bar claim for asbestosis); VaSalle v. Celotex Corp., 161 Ill.App.3d 808, 811, 113 Ill. Dec. 699, 702, 515 N.E.2d 684, 687 (1987) (plaintiff's cause of action for lung cancer not time barred by earlier diagnosis of asbestosis); Smith v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 303 Md. 213, 234, 492 A.2d 1286, 1296 (1985) (answering a certified question court stated that if claimant's colon cancer was a latent disease separate and distinct from asbestosis, claim was neither barred by the statute of limitations nor even by a prior action for asbestosis); Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 296 Md. 656, 667-69, 464 A.2d 1020, 1028 (1983) (claim for lung cancer was not time barred despite a prior diagnosis of asbestosis); Larson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 427 Mich. 301, 319, 399 N.W.2d 1, 9 (1986) (one plaintiff's action for cancer and another's for mesothelioma were not time barred by prior diagnoses of asbestosis); Fusaro v. Porter-Hayden Co., 145 Misc.2d 911, 918, 548 N.Y.S.2d 856, 859-60 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1989) (claim for mesothelioma not time barred by earlier asbestosis diagnosis); Potts v. Celotex Corp., 796 S.W.2d 678, 684 (Tenn.1990) (answering a certified question court stated that a mesothelioma claim was not time barred by an earlier diagnosis of asbestosis).
Contra Joyce v. A.C. & S., Inc., 785 F.2d 1200, 1203-05 (4th Cir.1986) (asbestosis claim was time barred because action accrued upon earlier diagnosis of pleural thickening); Ross v. Johns-Manville Corp., 766 F.2d 823, 828 (3d Cir.1985) (applying Pennsylvania law claim for colon cancer was time barred since claim accrued when plaintiff was diagnosed with asbestosis); Cathcart v. Keene Indus. Insulation, 324 Pa.Super. 123, 136-37, 471 A.2d 493, 506-07 (1984) (claim for asbestosis was time barred because claim accrued upon earlier diagnosis of pleural thickening); Staino v. Johns-Manville Corp., 304 Pa.Super. 280, 296, 450 A.2d 681, 688-89 (1982) (claim for pleural thickening would be time barred because action would have accrued on diagnosis of asbestosis); Pecorino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 763 S.W.2d 561, 569 (Tex.App.1988) (claim for mesothelioma was time barred since cause of action accrued upon earlier diagnosis of asbestosis).
The manifestation of asbestosis does not trigger the running of the statute of limitations on all separate, distinct, and later-manifested diseases which may have stemmed from the same asbestos exposure.
