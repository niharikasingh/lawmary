It is my conclusion that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, and I dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which after determining that Chandler was obligated to pay for the plywood it received, then proceeds to grant an offset to Chandler for an alleged debt owed to it by North America Millwork.
 The basic reason for this dissent is that the majority opinion in effect grants to Chandler an offset for a trade debt allegedly due Chandler from North America, who is neither a party to this action, nor in privity with Continental.
Co. v. Western Equities, Inc., 173 Cal.App.2d 420, 343 P.2d 408 (1959), the California Supreme Court again emphasized the necessity of mutuality in setoff cases in the following language: "A counterclaim or a setoff is defined as a cause of action in favor of the defendant on which he might have sued the plaintiff in a separate action and, in the case of a counterclaim, might have obtained affirmative relief * * *.
This conclusion is then followed by a refusal of the majority opinion to consider what in my opinion is one of the crucial points of the case, i.e., whether Continental ever received the copies of the acknowledgment of orders on which Earl Chandler had written "Purchased from North America Millwork.
The majority opinion in faulting Continental for its activities in effect holds the trial court erred when it specifically found "the return acknowledgment with the notation by Mr. Earl Chandler was not received by Continental Forest Products."
Extended discussion of these would be futile in a dissent and would unduly lengthen it
