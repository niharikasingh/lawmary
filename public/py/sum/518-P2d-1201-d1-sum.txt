It is my conclusion that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, and I dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which after determining that Chandler was obligated to pay for the plywood it received, then proceeds to grant an offset to Chandler for an alleged debt owed to it by North America Millwork.  The basic reason for this dissent is that the majority opinion in effect grants to Chandler an offset for a trade debt allegedly due Chandler from North America, who is neither a party to this action, nor in privity with Continental. Stringent requirements are established for a court to recognize an offset.
In Petersen v. Lyders, 139 Cal.App. 303, 33 P.2d 1030, 1031 (1934), cert. den. 294 U.S. 716, 55 S.Ct. 514, 79 L.Ed. 1249, reh. den. 294 U.S. 734, 55 S.Ct. 635, 79 L.Ed. 1262, the Supreme Court of California considered statutes governing the right to setoff which were identical to Idaho's: "It is elementary that a set-off may not be invoked unless the parties and the debts are mutual and that the doctrine of mutuality requires that the debts be due to and from the same persons in the same capacity."
The alleged debt is owing from North America to Chandler, Continental has not been shown to have been connected with North America by agency, contract, or assignment, and the trial court did not find any such relationship between Continental and North America. The majority opinion reaches its final conclusion on the basis that Chandler was going to be unjustly enriched if it was allowed to retain the plywood shipped by Continental without paying somebody.
Extended discussion of these would be futile in a dissent and would unduly lengthen it
