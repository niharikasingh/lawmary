This is an appeal from an order of the district court, 320 F.Supp. 816, granting plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction against defendant's licensing or contracting to license the showing of a particular motion picture at any theatre within the Philadelphia area other than that owned by plaintiff.
In April of 1970, defendant (Columbia), a motion picture distributor, granted to plaintiff (The 1812), the owner and operator of The 1812 Theatre, a license for the exclusive first-run Philadelphia exhibition of a motion picture entitled "Husbands."
Shortly after the licensing agreement was executed, however, Columbia notified The 1812 that it would not be able to deliver "Husbands" on or about the proposed delivery date of July 8, 1970  because of difficulties between Columbia and John Cassavetes, the producer of the motion picture, concerning the final cutting of the film.
Ruling that every motion picture is a "unique" production and that The 1812's inability to obtain "Husbands" might cause an intangible loss of good will, which it described as "theatre momentum," the court concluded that The 1812 would not have an adequate remedy at law for breach of contract since proof of damages would be difficult and speculative, if not impossible.
Here, although the parties entered into a commercial contract whose primary purpose was one of mutual pecuniary benefit, The 1812 maintains that "Husbands" has a value which is so extraordinary that the theatre's mere recovery of lost profits would be inadequate.
The order of the district court will be reversed
