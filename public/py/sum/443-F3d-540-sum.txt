The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to require Amgen to provide them with the drug immediately.
Moreover, the plaintiffs have submitted affidavits from all of the doctors participating in the University of Kentucky study and principal investigators involved in the New York and Chicago studies that unanimously state that GDNF is safe and effective.
The plaintiffs submitted to the district court an affidavit from the principal investigator of the New York study suggesting that the primates's legions were not a cause for alarm as the primates received larger doses of GDNF than study participants received and because the primates, unlike the study participants, were rapidly withdrawn from GDNF.
On June 24, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction requiring Amgen to provide the physicians at the University of Kentucky with GDNF and to allow the doctors to administer it to the plaintiffs.
The district court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to   demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits based on any of their claims.
The district court also concluded that the plaintiffs could not prove that they would suffer irreparable harm if they did not obtain a preliminary injunction nor could they establish that public policy would be furthered by issuing the injunction.
The district court's decision to deny the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction relied in part on a decision from the Southern District of New York in a nearly identical case, Suthers v. Amgen, Inc., 372 F.Supp.2d 416 (S.D.N.Y.2005).
In Suthers, two Parkinson's disease sufferers who participated in the Amgen study at the New York University site filed suit against Amgen in the Southern District of New York and sought a preliminary injunction requiring Amgen to provide them with GDNF.
The court found that the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim was unlikely to succeed because the plaintiffs could not show any contract between the plaintiffs and Amgen.
While their Informed Consent document arguably gave them a right to GDNF, the court concluded that this agreement was between the plaintiffs and New York University rather than the plaintiffs and Amgen, and that the principal investigators did not have the authority to bind Amgen.
The plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in denying their motion for a preliminary injunction.
To determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a district court must consider: "(1) the plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the impact of an injunction upon the public interest."
Turning first to the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim, the district court concluded that there was no breach of contract by Amgen because no contract ever existed between the plaintiffs and Amgen that required Amgen to continue to provide the plaintiffs with GDNF.
Thus, the plaintiffs' claim that Amgen is directly contractually obligated to provide the plaintiffs with GDNF is unlikely to succeed on the merits because "it is axiomatic that courts cannot bind a non-party to a contract because that party never agreed to the terms set forth therein."
  Moreover, the principal investigators in the University of Kentucky study were not in a position to enter into a binding contract with the plaintiffs on Amgen's behalf, as the district court correctly concluded that the principal investigators were independent contractors rather than Amgen's agents.
Thus, the above factors indicate that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was unlikely that any direct agency relationship existed between Amgen and the University of Kentucky or its physicians.
Nothing in the record nor in the plaintiffs' brief demonstrates any representations made by Amgen to the plaintiffs that could have led the plaintiffs to believe that the principal investigators were agents of Amgen for purposes of the study.
The plaintiffs' promissory estoppel argument is premised on their claim that the principal investigators informed them that they would make decisions based upon the patients's best interests and that if GDNF proved to be safe and effective, study participants could continue to receive the medication following termination of the study.
The district court held that Amgen had no fiduciary duty to continue to supply the plaintiffs with GDNF.
The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs' likelihood of success on this claim is minimal.
Thus, the district court did not abused its discretion in concluding that there is no evidence Amgen has a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.
The manner in which the district court in Suthers distinguished Grimes from Amgen's GDNF study is helpful: In Grimes, the Maryland Supreme Court found that medical researchers owed a duty sounding in tort to children whose parents had been induced to live in homes containing lead paint so that the paint's effects could be measured against a control population without such exposure.
While there is evidence in the record that supports the plaintiffs' claim, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.
Therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs failed to establish they would suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.
As to the third factor of the preliminary injunction test the district court concluded that "on balance, the court would side with the plaintiffs on this prong."
We therefore AFFIRM the district court's ruling
