Enterprise Co. v. Landers, 131 F. 240 (C. C. A. 2); Yale & Towne Co. v. Adler, 154 F. 37 (C. C. A. 2); Rushmore v. Manhattan Co., 163 F. 939, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 269 (C. C. A. 2); Rushmore v. Badger Co., 198 F. 379 (C. C. A. 2); Fox v. Glynn, 191 Mass. 344, 78 N. E. 89, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1096, 114 Am. St. Rep. 619.
Of the cases on which the plaintiff relies, the chief is International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L. Ed. 211, 2 A. L. R. 293.
