If the promise contemplated that Davis & Co. were to pay Morgan $10 per month for that part of the year which had already passed, and as to which there had been a settlement, it was manifestly nudum pactum; for a past transaction, the obligation of which has been fully satisfied, will not sustain a new promise.
The case is something like that of Bush v. Rawlins, 89 Ga. 117, 14 S. E. 886, where the landlord agreed to give  the tenant certain property if he would pay his rent promptly; and it was held that such a promise was a gratuity, and void, as without consideration to support it.
But, as It was, Morgan proved that Davis promised to pay more for the performance of the old contract than he had originally agreed.
It was argued that the moral obligation would support the promise here, and undoubtedly there are cases in which such consideration has been held to be sufficient.
In an agreement by one partner to pay the other for extra work (Gray v. Hamil, 82 Ga. 375, 10 S. E. 205, 6 L. R. A. 72); in the promise by a landlord to refund to tenant's money paid by them for worthless fertilizer (Parrott v. Johnson, 61 Ga. 475); and in the agreement by a brother to account to a sister for her interest as an heir at law in land which he had improperly induced the father to convey (Brown v. Latham, 92 Ga. 280, 18 S. E. 421)â€”the court recognized that there was a moral obligation to support the promise, but in each of the cases there was something very close akin to a legal obligation or to a trust.
Judgment reversed
