By the Revenue Act of (November 23,) 1921, c. 136, ยง 213(a) gross income includes "gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever," and by the Treasury Regulations authorized by ยง 1303, that have been in force through repeated reenactments, "If the corporation purchases and retires any of such bonds at a price less than the issuing price or face value, the excess of the issuing price or face value over the purchase price is gain or income for the taxable year."
At the time of payment the marks had fallen in value, which so far as it went was a gain for the defendant in error, and it was contended by the plaintiff in error that the gain was taxable income.
Judgment reversed.
