Shutts I, 222 Kan., at 534, 567 P. 2d, at 1299 (emphasis added). The indemnity which Phillips required was a corporate  security bond covering a principal amount based on estimated production for a 2-year period, plus the 7% interest rate Phillips would be required to pay to its customers if the price increase were not approved.
The situation was succinctly summarized by the Kansas Supreme Court in Shutts I: "From June 1, 1961, to October 1, 1970, Phillips deposited the increased rate monies collected in its general account and commingled it with its other funds, without ever giving notice of this fact to royalty owners during the time it was holding money.
Both cases involve what the Kansas Supreme Court has characterized as a "common fund" consisting of the suspense royalties undeniably owed by Phillips  but not paid for periods of several years while Commission approval of rate increases were pending. It is undisputed that Phillips enjoyed the unfettered use of that money.
(emphasis deleted).  In Shutts I, the Kansas Supreme Court held that general equitable principles required the award of interest on royalties owned to royalty owners but used by Phillips for a number of years.
In support of that conclusion it relied on general statements in two Kansas cases and a long line of federal cases applying Texas law and concluding that equity requires "the award of interest on suspense royalties under similar circumstances."
Significantly, when the Texas Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the Stahl judgment, it relied on the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in Shutts I to decide that equity as well as contract law requires interest on suspense royalties.
The Kansas Supreme Court noted that the statutory rate in all three States expressly applied only when no other rate had been agreed upon, and that in this case Phillips had made an express agreement, evidenced by its corporate undertaking, to pay interest at the rate set by the Commission on suspense moneys found refundable.
Finally, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected Phillips' contention that royalty owners had "waived" their claims to interest by accepting payment of the royalties later or by failing to post an indemnity "acceptable" to Phillips in order to receive contemporaneous payment of suspense royalties.
235 Kan., at 211, 679 P. 2d, at 1174. Noting that "Phillips has not satisfactorily established why this court should not apply the rule enunciated in Shutts I, " the Kansas court went on to state that once jurisdiction over  a "nationwide class action" is properly asserted, "the law of the forum should be applied unless compelling reasons exist for applying a different law."
222 Kan., at 557, 567 P. 2d, at 1314. While a common-law judge might disagree with the substantive legal determinations made by the Kansas court (although nothing in its opinion seems erroneous to me), that court's approach to the possible choices of law evinces precisely the "full faith and credit" that the Constitution requires.
In this case it is perfectly clear that there has been no due process violation because this is a classic "false conflicts" case. Phillips has not demonstrated that any significant conflicts exist merely because Oklahoma and Texas state case law is silent concerning the equitable theories developed by the Kansas courts in this litigation, or even because the language of some Oklahoma and Texas statutes suggests that those States would "most likely" reach different results.
I therefore can find no due process violation in the Kansas court's decision.  IV In final analysis, the Court today may merely be expressing its disagreement with the Kansas Supreme Court's statement that in a "nationwide class action...the law of the forum should be applied unless compelling reasons exist for applying a different law."
Considering this statement against the background of the Kansas Supreme Court's careful analysis in Shutts I, however, I am confident that court would agree that every state court has an obligation under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to "respect the legitimate interests of other States and avoid infringement upon their sovereignty."
When a suit involves claims connected to States other than the forum State, the Constitution requires only that the relevant laws of other States that are brought to the attention of the forum court be examined fairly prior to making a choice of law. Because this Court "reviews judgments, not opinions," Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984), criticism of a portion of the Kansas  court's opinion taken out of context provides an insufficient basis for reversing its judgment.
A review of the record and the underlying litigation here convincingly demonstrates that, despite Phillips' protestations regarding Kansas' development of common-law principles, no disregard for the laws of other States nor unfair application of Kansas law to the litigants has occurred. Phillips has no constitutional right to avoid judgment in Kansas because it might have convinced a court in another State to develop its law differently.
Accordingly, while I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, I respectfully dissent from Part III and from the judgment
