Specifically, the master made no findings regarding what an "owner...voluntarily selling his land" would have done that the lenders here did not do, in order to obtain a fair price.
The master's report stated that the lenders "did not establish an upset price or minimum bid," and that they "did not cause the property to be reappraised," but there is nothing in the record to show that an owner conducting a voluntary sale would have done these things.
The master correctly noted that "[a] foreclosure sale...usually produces a price less than the property's fair market value," so it is virtually certain that any upset price would have been less than that amount.
Because it is unclear whether the master applied the correct standard regarding the mortgagees' duty, and because the record as presently constituted cannot support a determination that the lenders violated that standard, I respectfully dissent
