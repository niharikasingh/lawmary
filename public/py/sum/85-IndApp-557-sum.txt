Whereupon appellant commenced this action against the state to recover the market value of the coal.
The state not having assigned cross-errors, the only question for determination by this court is whether, under the facts stipulated, the measure of recovery is the market value ofthe coal at the time and place of the misdelivery; or, as held by the trial court, the price at which the Joint Purchasing Committee had purchased the year's supply.
Woodward, Law of Quasi Contracts, ยง3; Quasi-Contractual Obligations, 21 Yale Law J. 533; Grossbier V. Chicago, etc., R. Co. (1921), 173 Wis. 503, 181 N. W. 746. 11 The legal obligation of the state in this action is to pay to appellant a sum equal to the benefit to the state which resulted from the misdelivery.
The state having contracted, in the way provided by the statute, for a year's supply of coal for its penal institution, at the price of $3. per ton, the state's representatives could not, by their mistake in receiving from a common carrier coal of a like quality, but which had been sold and consigned to another, obligate the state to pay the carrier for the coal a price in excess of the state's contract price, the carrier having been a party to the mistake.
We hold that the measure of recovery is the state's contract price, and not the market value of the coal at the time and place of the misdelivery. 13 Affirmed
