And the constitutional right of trial by jury controls the exercise of judicial power at the trial level to set aside a verdict as contrary to the weight of the evidence and for  appellate relief to the same end; the court "may not merely weigh the evidence where it is fairly susceptible of divergent inferences and substitute its own judgment for that of the jury," but if the verdict be "so far contrary to the weight of the evidence as to give rise to the inescapable conclusion of mistake, passion, prejudice, or partiality," it transcends the constitutional province of the jury and is remediable as an excess of power; the court may not set aside a verdict merely because, in its opinion, the jury upon the evidence might well have found otherwise; and this conception of the weight of the evidence applies to civil and criminal cases.
The court continued: "There is great difference between cases of damages which [may] be certainly seen, and such as are ideal, as between assumpsit, trespass for goods where the sum and value may be measured, and  actions of imprisonment, malicious prosecution, slander and other personal torts, where the damages are matter of opinion, speculation, ideal; there is also a difference between a principal verdict of a jury, and a writ of inquiry of damages, the latter being only an inquest of office to inform the conscience of the Court, and which they might have assessed themselves without any inquest at all; only in the case of maihem, Courts have in all ages interposed in that single instance only; as to the case of the writ of inquiry in the Year-Book of H.4, we doubt whether what is said by the Court in that case be right, that they would abridge the damages unless the plaintiff would release part thereof, because there is not one case to be found in the Year-Books where ever the Court abridged the damages after a principal verdict, and this is clear down to the time of [Hawkim v. Sciet] Palmer's Rep. 314, [81 Eng. Repr., 1099] much less have they interposed in increasing damages, except in the case of maihem; * * *."
In Watt v. Watt (1905), A.C. 115, 6 B.R.C. 1, 2 Ann. Cas. 672, the House of Lords said the idea that the court could with the consent of the plaintiff reduce the amount of the damages probably arose from the fact that in the old cases the courts had "adopted the somewhat unconstitutional proceeding of refusing to give the plaintiff judgment unless he would consent to reduce his claim to what ought to be considered reasonable," an indirect method implying the need for the plaintiff's assent; and that since the defendant was not likely to refuse his assent to a proceeding intended for his benefit, the theory of the cases seems to  have been that the right of the court to interfere with the verdict depended upon the consent of both parties; and the contrary hypothesis here contended for was utterly repudiated as alien to the common law and sound English practice.
The Earl of Halsbury, L.C. there affirmed that the Court of Appeal "has no jurisdiction to fix the amount of damages without the consent of both parties"; he attributed the "confusion" in this regard to the practice upon demurrer or default, where the court may have the sheriff assess the damages, the usual course, or "* * * decide that question for itself — probably because that question is often a question of law, where the damages are fixed by law * * *," and he noted the "* * * distinction between trial by jury and mere inquisition or inquiry by a jury to assess damages — that, in the latter case the inquisition was only to inform the mind of the court and it was at their discretion whether they would award judgment for the amount found by the jury, where as upon a trial they had no jurisdiction to interfere as to the amount of damages in cases of tort," citing Reeves' History of the Common Law, and that the "theory of all the cases seems to me to be that the right of the court to interfere with a jury's verdict was only to be by the assent of both parties."
He observed that "this court in a very special sense is charged with the duty of construing and upholding the Constitution; and in the discharge of that important duty, it ever must be alert to see that a doubtful precedent [involving remittitur] be not extended by mere analogy to a different case if the result will be to weaken or subvert what it conceives to be a principle of the fundamental law of the land"; and that "the power to conditionally increase the verdict of a jury does not follow as a necessary corollary from the power to conditionally decrease it," since in the case of a conditional remittitur "a jury has already awarded a sum in excess of that fixed by the court as a basis for a remittitur, which at least finds some support in the early English practice, while in the second case, no jury has ever passed on the increased amount, and the practice has no precedent according to the rules of the common law."
The "controlling distinction between the power of the court and that of the jury," said Justice Sutherland, "is that the former is the power to determine the law and the latter to determine the facts," and while the remittitur practice in the case of an excessive verdict "is not without plausible support in the view that what remains is included in the verdict along with the unlawful excess, — in the sense that it has been found by the jury, — and that the remittitur has the effect of merely lopping off an excrescence," yet where an inadequate verdict is increased by the court there is a "bald addition of something which in no sense can be  said to be included in the verdict," and if that be done with the consent of the defendant alone, the plaintiff is compelled to forego his "constitutional right to the verdict of a jury and accept `an assessement partly made by a jury which has acted improperly, and partly by a tribunal which has no power to assess.'"
The reasoning of the minority in Dimick proceeds on the hypothesis, "long accepted in the federal courts," that the "exercise of judicial discretion in denying a motion for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict is too small or too large, is not subject to review on writ of error or appeal," a "special application of the more general rule that an  appellate court will not re-examine the facts which induced the trial court to grant or deny a new trial," and the unwilling plaintiff whose inadequate verdict has been increased by the court "has suffered no denial of a right because the court, staying its hand, has left the verdict undisturbed, as it lawfully might have done if the defendant had refused to pay more than the verdict," and, although the common law had made no rule on the subject in 1791, the court could not "rightly refuse to apply to either the principle of general application that it is competent to exercise a discretionary power to grant or withhold relief in any way which is not unjust," analogizing the judge's function, "when sitting in equity," to withhold "relief upon the compliance with a condition, the performance of which will do substantial justice," citing Belt v. Lawes, L.R. 12 Q.B. Div. 356 (C.A. 1884), a remittitur case overruled by the House of Lords in Watt v. Watt, cited supra.
