As this Court explained in Evaluation Systems, Inc. v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., 555 F.Supp. 116, 120 (N.D.Ill.1982), the Illinois Appellate Courts are sharply divided on that issue: Without even addressing the preemptive implications of the statutory remedy, the Fifth District Appellate Court recognized [573 F.Supp. 195] an independent tort action against insurers for breach of their implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.
1477 (1941)) demands adherence to the Illinois "internal" choice of law rule that binds a state trial court to the decisions of the Appellate Court in its own district when the Appellate Courts diverge.

Or is Judge Marshall somehow exercising the "predictive" approach sub silentio and deciding, despite any contrary indications from any Illinois appellate court at any level, that the Illinois Supreme Court would disapprove the rules enunciated in Thorpe and Garcia?
That possibility of course exists (though neither Judge Marshall nor this Court is omniscient, so that his acting on that possibility poses a separate risk — if he is wrong in his prediction — that the federal litigant may get a different brand of justice than the Illinois courts would in fact deliver, not only at the trial court level commensurate with our own but at the Illinois Appellate [573 F.Supp. 199] Court level as well!
And that disparate treatment is given solely because — on the false assumption that all cases go all the way to the top of the state judicial ladder — the occasional litigant might obtain a different result under the approach this Court follows (adhering as it does to the Illinois rules governing precedential value).
That is why Judge Marshall is simply wrong in saying (Roberts, 568 F.Supp. at 539): [W]e think that Commercial Discount begins with an erroneous premise: that a [573 F.Supp. 200] federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction "must decide substantive questions in the same way that a state trial judge counterpart sitting at the same location would."
