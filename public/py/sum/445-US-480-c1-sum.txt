I join the opinion of the Court except for Part IV-B. I agree with Part IV-B insofar as the Court holds that qualified and independent assistance must be provided to an inmate who is threatened with involuntary transfer to a state mental hospital.
I do not agree, however, that the requirement of independent assistance demands that a licensed attorney be provided. 1   I In Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), my opinion for the Court held that counsel is not necessarily required at a probation revocation hearing.
Consideration of these factors, and particularly the capability of the inmate, persuades me that the Court is correct that independent assistance must be provided to an inmate before he may be transferred involuntarily to a mental hospital.
I therefore agree    that due process requires the provision of assistance to an inmate threatened with involuntary transfer to a mental hospital.
Due process will be satisfied so long as an inmate facing involuntary transfer to a mental hospital is provided qualified and independent assistance
