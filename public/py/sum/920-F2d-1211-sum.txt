The central question presented by this appeal is whether a court may dismiss an action for failure to join an indispensable party, notwithstanding defendant's ability to join the party in question by asserting a compulsory counterclaim against it.
Towers argued that the suit must be dismissed since joinder of the building's landlord, 417 Fifth Avenue Corp. ("417 Fifth") — which was required in order to afford the parties complete relief — would strip the court of diversity jurisdiction.
In the alternative, Associated argues that Towers' ability to join 417 Fifth as a party — by asserting a compulsory counterclaim against it — precludes the court from dismissing the action "in equity and good conscience."
Towers moved to dismiss the action, alleging that 417 Fifth was an indispensable party that if joined would destroy complete diversity, thereby divesting the court of jurisdiction.
During the pendency of the Rule 12(b) and summary judgment motions, Towers initiated a state court action joining both Associated and 417 Fifth as defendants.
DISCUSSION Associated argues that because Towers has the ability to join 417 Fifth by asserting a compulsory counterclaim against it, the court cannot in equity and good conscience dismiss the suit for failure to join an indispensable party.
Rule 19(a) provides in pertinent part: A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
The court based its decision on Towers' assertion in its motion to dismiss that if 417 Fifth was not joined Towers would be unable to obtain "full relief" on counterclaims it intended to bring against Associated and 417 Fifth. The court noted: "According to Towers' proposed answer and counterclaims, unless the Landlord is compelled to change its course and to act on the plans submitted, Towers will never be able to enjoy quietly the premises it had leased  from A[ssociated]." Associated Dry Goods Corp. v. Towers Fin. Corp., 127 F.R.D. 57, 61 (S.D.N.Y.1989).
Nevertheless, we accept for present purposes that 417 Fifth's inclusion in the action is necessary in order to afford complete relief to the parties. 417 Fifth may be considered a party to be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a), since without 417 Fifth, Towers would not be able to obtain full injunctive relief on any counterclaim it asserts against Associated to increase electrical capacity.
Associated cannot join 417 Fifth as a party to the action, however, because the addition of 417 Fifth, a non-diverse party, would destroy complete diversity and strip the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.
Towers contends that it may not assert counterclaims against 417 Fifth because, in light of Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545, 109 S.Ct. 2003, 104 L.Ed.2d 593 (1989), the district court would lack jurisdiction over those claims.
Therefore, we find that Finley does not bar the district court from exercising ancillary jurisdiction over any Rule 13(h) counterclaim that Towers asserts against 417 Fifth. See King Fisher Marine Serv. v. 21st Phoenix Corp., 893 F.2d 1155, 1161 (10th Cir. ), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 2603, 110 L.Ed.2d 283 (1990); see also Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. C and A Currency Exchange, Inc., 738 F.Supp. 302, 304 (N.D.Ill.1990) ("court hence hesitates to seize upon Finley's ambiguous statement in order to `roll back' the entire area of federal jurisdiction over third-party claims"); Huberman v. Duane Fellows, Inc., 725 F.Supp. 204, 207 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (court "does not read Finley as threatening jurisdiction over impleaded third-party defendants.").
In light of the foregoing, the district court's judgment is reversed and the action is remanded for further proceedings
