Williams and Mize appeal from the denial of their motion to extend the time in which to file an independent action on a claim against the estate of Roy Levon Williams. Pursuant to section 733.705(3), Florida Statutes (1984):     The claimant is limited to a period of 30 days from the date of service of an objection within which to bring an independent action upon the claim and within which to file written notice of such action in the estate proceeding.
In Bell v. Harris, 366 So.2d 765 (Fla. 1st DCA 1978), the attorney filed the independent law suit, as in this case, in the Probate Division rather than the Circuit Court Division. Similarly, in In re Estate of Oxford, an independent suit was filed nineteen days late because the attorney representing claimants was changed, as in this case, close to the required time for filing.
We think that in this case, the rush to file the suit on the last day, without sufficient time for appellants' attorney to research the substance or procedure of the claim, plus appellants' diligent efforts thereafter to pursue their claim, afforded a sufficient factual basis for "good cause" to extend time to file the independent suit.
We think this case is distinguishable from In re Goldman, 79 So.2d 846 (Fla. 1955), where there was an eleven-month delay in seeking permission to extend time to file suit, caused solely by the claimant's attorney's misunderstanding of the applicable Probate Code provision.
