The amended complaint should be dismissed because the misrepresentations alleged relate only to future expectations. 21 No doubt a remedy in tort would be available to the plaintiff if the fraudulent promissory representations dealt with matters completely under the control of the defendant and implemented existing contractual obligations (Sabo v. Delman, 3 N Y 2d 155; A. S. Rampell, Inc., v. Hyster Co., 3 N Y 2d 369).
But here the defendant made no promise and the plaintiff parted with nothing. 22  As we regard them, the alleged representations do not reflect a statement of present intention which could be judged a statement of an existing fact which may be the basis for a fraud action. 23 Therefore, the order appealed from should be reversed and the amended complaint should be dismissed 
Cases such as Deyo v. Hudson (225 N.Y. 602) and Adams v. Clark (supra) are cited to uphold this doctrine.
