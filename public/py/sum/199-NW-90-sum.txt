He alleges, however, that in the month of June the parties made a further oral agreement, for the purpose of more securely assuring plaintiff that he would receive certain cash rent accruing in prior years, wherein defendant agreed to buy 100 head of cattle and bring upon the farm and consume good pasture thereon, and that plaintiff agreed to provide, keep, and maintain on the farm a well, watering equipment, and water ample and sufficient for the needs of such 100 head of cattle, as well as for 67 head of cattle then owned and kept on the farm by the defendant, and that, relying upon such agreement, and being induced thereby, defendant purchased 107 heat of cattle; that plaintiff violated his agreement; that the water supply failed, and because thereof all the 174 head of cattle became wasted, thin, and depreciated in value, and defendants were damaged in the sum of $2,500. 7 The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed in the complaint, and, from an order denying defendantâ€™s motion for a new trial, he has appealed. 8 Our first inquiry is as to whether the oral contract as alleged by defendant is in fact established by the proofs.
Well he said 'Never mind the water, John, I will see there will be plenty of water because it never failed in Minnesota yet' and I say 'all right, I got it all arranged to get all the cattle I want from Long & Hanson in Sioux City, all I have to do is to go to the  phone and call them up and the cattle be here in 2 or 3 days.'
The minds of the parties never met upon the essential terms.
The proof in this respect is insufficient.
