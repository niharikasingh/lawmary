The district court summarily dismissed the complaint on the ground that it would not be possible for AFA to prove damages amounting to more than $50,000.
AFA commenced the present diversity action in the district court for misappropriation of its trade secrets, seeking an injunction against any use by Whitchurch of confidential AFA information, and damages "in an amount which is not presently ascertainable, but which is believed to exceed the sum of $50,000.00."
Rather, he stated, AFA had freely disseminated lists of the names and addresses of its customers to "countless individuals and entities," including hotels, booking and travel agents, and the tour participants themselves.
At the oral argument of Whitchurch's motion, Whitchurch's attorney began by characterizing the motion as "turn[ing] on a very narrow issue" of whether the AFA information constituted trade secrets (Hearing Transcript, November 16, 1990 ("Tr. "), at 1), and stating that the case was important to Whitchurch because "he may one day in the future wish to organize a tour, and write letters to individuals again" (id.
In response to the court's jurisdictional question, Whitchurch's attorney stated that Whitchurch, in soliciting for his planned tour, had written to 100-200 former AFA  tour participants but had received favorable responses from only two.
AFA's attorney argued that Whitchurch's lack of success on his first effort was hardly dispositive of the issue of the amount of damages AFA might suffer, in light of Whitchurch's desire to conduct other tours in the future.
In his letter to former AFA tour participants, for example, Whitchurch had offered the addressees their "first" opportunity to join his planned 28-day tour and said, "If you would like to be on my mailing list for future tours, please fill out and return the enclosed form.
AFA's attorney, noting that over the years Whitchurch had escorted some 1,500 AFA clients on tours and had indicated that he would conduct a number of tours, argued that AFA's damages would be substantial.
Though the court styled its decision as one granting summary judgment and stated that it had a "very serious question" as to whether the AFA lists were trade secrets, it did not purport to resolve that question.
The amount of damages recoverable in an action for misappropriation of trade secrets may be measured either by the plaintiff's losses, see, e.g., Timely Products Corp. v. Arron, 523 F.2d 288, 304 (2d Cir.1975); see generally 2 R. Milgrim, Milgrim on Trade Secrets ("Milgrim") ยง 7.08[a], at 7-314 to 7-318 (1990), or by the profits unjustly received by the defendant, see id.
For example, he said Whitchurch had the names of some 1,500 AFA customers; this was consistent with (a) Whitchurch's own statement that in the 17 years he was employed by AFA he had led approximately seven tours each year (thus totaling some 119 tours) and (b) his attorney's statement that there were usually 10-15 people per tour.
If there were no repeat customers among the persons Whitchurch escorted, he could have escorted some 1,785 AFA tour participants (119 ร 15).
If a tour operator could earn 17% of the price of a tour, and if Whitchurch were eventually successful in soliciting even 30 of the approximately 1,500 AFA participants  he has escorted (i.e., 2%, which may reflect the ratio of his success on his first attempt), the profit he could siphon from AFA would total $51,000.
Presumably such an injunction would include a prohibition against Whitchurch's sale or disclosure of the names and addresses of AFA's customers to other tour operators who might be better equipped than Whitchurch to exploit the information and attract more than 2% of the persons whose names Whitchurch could provide them.
The Merits of AFA's Trade Secrets Claims Finally, even if Whitchurch were correct in his contention that the court dismissed AFA's trade secrets claims on the merits rather than for lack of jurisdiction, the dismissal could not stand.
As set forth in Part I above, in opposition to Whitchurch's motion for summary judgment, AFA submitted several affidavits describing both the efforts it had made to develop a customer list that was not available from any other source, and efforts it had made to prevent dissemination of the names on that list except to persons actually participating in the tours and persons who needed to know those names in order to service the AFA tours.
The judgment is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing
