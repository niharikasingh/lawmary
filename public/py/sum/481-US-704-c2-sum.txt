I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately to note that in my view the present statute, insofar as concerns the balance between rights taken and rights left untouched, is indistinguishable from the statute that was at issue in Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979).
Because that comparison is determinative of whether there has been a taking, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 136 (1978); Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922), in finding a taking today our decision effectively limits Allard to its facts
