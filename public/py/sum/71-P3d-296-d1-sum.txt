The majority's reasoning would find that notwithstanding the time it takes the workers to remove the paint and the expense they incur in altering the bumpers to prevent further unwanted messages, candidate B does not deserve an injunction unless the paint is so heavy that it reduces the cars' gas mileage or otherwise depreciates the cars' market value.
But as counsel for Intel explained during oral argument, the company objects to Hamidi's using Intel's property to advance his message.
The majority refuses to protect Intel's interest in maintaining the integrity of its own system, contending that (1) Hamidi's mailings did not physically injure the system; (2) Intel receives many unwanted messages, of which Hamidi's are but a small fraction; (3) Intel must have contemplated that it would receive some unwanted messages; and (4) Hamidi used the email system for its intended purpose, to communicate with employees.
In Thrifty-Tel v. Bezenek (1996) 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559, 54 Cal. Rptr. 2d 468 (Thrifty-Tel ), the Court of Appeal found a trespass to chattels where the defendants used another party's access code to search for an authorization code with which they could make free calls.
The defendants' calls did not damage the company's system in any way; they were a minuscule fraction of the overall communication conducted by the phone network; and the company could have reasonably expected that some individuals would attempt to obtain codes with which to make free calls (just as stores expect shoplifters).
Contrary to these concerns, the Court of Appeal decision belongs not to a nightmarish future but to an unremarkable pasta long line of cases protecting the right of an  individual not to receive an unwanted message after having expressed that refusal to the speaker.
As the United States Supreme Court observed, "we have repeatedly held that individuals are not required to welcome unwanted speech into their homes" (Frisby v. Schultz (1988) 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S. Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420), whether the unwanted speech comes in the form of a door-to-door solicitor (see Martin, at pp. 147-148, 63 S. Ct. 862), regular "snail" mail (Rowan, supra, 397 U.S. 728, 90 S. Ct. 1484, 25 L. Ed. 2d 736), radio waves (FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (1978) 438 U.S. 726, 98 S. Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073), or other forms of amplified sound (Kovacs v. Cooper (1949) 336 U.S. 77, 69 S. Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513).
(See also Church of Christ in Hollywood v. Superior Court (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 1244, 121 Cal. Rptr. 2d 810 (Church of Christ).) The Supreme Court reaffirmed this rule in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner (1972) 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219, 33 L. Ed. 2d 131 (Lloyd) and Hudgens v.  NLRB (1976) 424 U.S. 507, 96 S. Ct. 1029, 47 L. Ed. 2d 196, where private shopping mall owners validly excluded speakers from their malls.
In Loving v. Boren, supra, 956 F.Supp. at page 955, the court held that the University of Oklahoma could restrict the use of its computer system to exclude pornographic messages, notwithstanding the contrary preferences of any individual faculty member (or student).
Whereas the mall owners had been asked merely to allow others to speak, Intel, through its server, must itself actively "participate in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on ... private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read...." (Wooley v. Maynard (1977) 430 U.S. 705, 713, 97 S. Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752.)
(Rowan, supra, 397 U.S. 728, 90 S. Ct. 1484, 25 L. Ed. 2d 736.)
In Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. (1983) 463 U.S. 60, 103 S. Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 (Bolger), the court struck down a law barring the mailing of information regarding contraception because the government was deciding which messages could be delivered.
Citing Martin, supra, 319 U.S. 141, 63 S. Ct. 862, 87 L. Ed. 1313, Rowan held "a mailer's right to communicate must stop at the mailbox of an unreceptive addressee.... [¶] ... [¶] To hold less would tend to license a form of trespass."
The majority expresses its agreement with the dissent below, which found that if the lost productivity of Intel's employees serves as the requisite injury, "then every unsolicited communication that does not further the business's objectives (including telephone calls) interferes with the chattel... [¶] ... [¶] ...
THE TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY ISSUED THE INJUNCTION Intel had the right to exclude the unwanted speaker from its property, which Hamidi does not dispute; he does not argue that he has a to right force unwanted messages on Intel. The instant case thus turns on the question of whether Intel deserves a remedy for the continuing violation of its rights.
Furthermore, there was actual injury as (1) Intel suffered economic loss; (2) it is sufficient for the injury to impair the chattel's utility to the owner rather than the chattel's market value; and (3) even in the absence of any injury to the owner's utility, it is nevertheless a trespass where one party expropriates for his own use the resources paid for by another.
The North Carolina Court of Appeal has found there is no damage requirement for a trespass to chattel.
The Restatement Second of Torts, section 218, which is less inclined to favor liability, likewise forbids unauthorized use and recognizes the inviolability of personal property.
The authorities agree, however, that (1) the chattel is inviolable, (2) the trespassee need not tolerate even harmless interference, and (3) the possessor may use reasonable force to prevent it.
The law is to the contrary; numerous cases have authorized injunctive relief to safeguard the inviolability of personal property.
The CompuServe court followed Tillman in authorizing an injunction to prevent the delivery of unwanted e-mail messages.
"[T]his Court holds  that where defendants engaged in a course of conduct of transmitting a substantial volume of electronic data in the form of unsolicited e-mail to plaintiffs proprietary computer equipment, where defendants continued such practice after repeated demands to cease and desist, and where defendants deliberately evaded plaintiffs affirmative efforts to protect its computer equipment from such use, plaintiff has a viable claim for trespass to personal property and is entitled to injunctive relief to protect its property."
Post-CompuServe case law has emphasized that unauthorized use of another's property establishes a trespass, even without a showing of physical damage.
The problem is that although Intel has resorted to the cyberspace version of reasonable force, it has so far been unsuccessful in determining how to resist the unwanted use of its system.
Finally, case law further recognizes as actionable the loss that occurs when one party maintains property for its own use and another party uses it, even if the property does not suffer damage as a result.
The economic costs of unwanted e-mail exist even if Intel employees, unlike CompuServe subscribers, do not pay directly for the time they spend on the Internet. No such direct costs appear here, only the opportunity costs of lost time.
Intel's injury is properly related to the chattel The majority does not dispute that Intel suffered a loss of work product as a matter of fact, so much as it denies that this loss may constitute the requisite injury as a matter of law.
The Restatement recognizes that the measure of impairment may be subjective; a cognizable injury may occur not only when the trespass reduces the chattel's market value but also when the trespass affects its value to the owner.
The Restatement goes on to explain that A's using B's toothbrush could extinguish its value to B. The brushing constitutes a trespass by impairing the brush's subjective value to the owner rather than its objective market value.
The unlawful use of another's property is a trespass, regardless of its effect on the property's utility to the owner Finally, even if Hamidi's interference did not affect the server's utility to Intel, it would still amount to a trespass.
The use by one party of property whose costs have been paid by another amounts to an unlawful taking of those resourceseven if there is no unjust enrichment by the trespassing party.
The federal district court found such unlawful use could constitute a trespass to chattels (if the facts were proved), and thus denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
Hamidi has thus unlawfully shifted the costs of his speaking to Intel. (Ferguson, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p. 1268, 115 Cal. Rptr. 2d 258; Blast Fax, supra, 323 F.3d at p. 652; Heckel, supra, 24 P.3d at p. 410.)
As in those cases in which courts have granted injunctions to prevent the delivery of unwanted mail, paper or electronic, Intel is not attempting to profit from its trespass action by receiving nominal damages.
The principles of both personal liberty and social utility should counsel us to usher the common law of property into the digital age
