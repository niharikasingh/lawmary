It is quite immaterial whether we call these defendants bailees or not if we keep in mind the fact that the possession of these goods was thrust upon them by mistake of the plaintiffs and without their invitation or consent, and that, therefore, any liability for failure to return the goods to the true owner upon demand must be the result of some act voluntarily done by the defendants thereafter.
An attempt to return the bond to the true owner or to the person who delivered it cannot be considered as inconsistent with a recognition of the complete ownership and right of dominion by the true owner and certainly shows no intent to accept the possession thrust upon the defendants by plaintiffs' mistake and I fail to see how, in the absence of such elements, any implied contract of bailment can arise.
If in making an attempt to return the goods, which was lawful and proper in itself, the defendants used means which were not reasonable and proper and as a result thereof the goods were lost or misdelivered, then the defendants would be liable for negligence or possibly for conversion, for every man is responsible for his own acts; but if the defendants had a right to divest themselves of possession and attempt to return the goods, then in the absence of some obligation resting upon contract to deliver the goods only to the true owner or upon his order, I do not see how the mere fact that through innocent mistake the defendants handed the bond to the wrong messenger could constitute a conversion.
It would serve no purpose to analyze them separately for in every case it very clearly appears that where a party has been held liable for failure to return goods to the true owner on demand one of the following elements appeared: 1, the defendant had accepted the deposit of the goods and was therefore under a contractual obligation to return them on demand; or 2, the goods were still in the possession of the defendant when the demand was made; or 3, the defendant had done some voluntary act consistent only with the view that he claimed some property in the goods either as owner or agent of the owner.
Until that time the defendants were under no obligation either to accept the bond as bailees or return it upon demand to the true owners unless at the time of the demand the bond was still in their possession; and it seems to me anomalous and illogical to say that an absolute obligation to return the bond to the plaintiffs and not to deliver it to any other person arises merely from the fact that the defendants did by mistake and through an honest disclaimer of any title or right of possession in the bond, physically deliver it to another.
While that case may perhaps logically be distinguished from the present case in that there the defendant did not know the true owner and was induced to give up possession of the goods to a thief through fraud, yet in my opinion these circumstances do not logically affect the rule that a person in possession of goods without his consent is not liable for conversion merely because he delivers them to a stranger in an attempt to revest possession in the true owner, though they may affect the question of the defendant's negligence and whether he has acted reasonably and properly, but only these questions.
Even if the Personal Property Law applies to the sale of a bond, these sections would not be applicable to the facts in this case for the evidence shows that the plaintiffs delivered the bond by mistake and without any intent to pass title to the bond in compliance with their contract and that the defendants did not "retain" the bond but, on the contrary, promptly divested themselves of its possession.
For these reasons it seems to me that the judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs
