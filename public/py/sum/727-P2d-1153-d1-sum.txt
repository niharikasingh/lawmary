Gissel now brings an action for the tort of conversion for one-half the value of the sold rice, claiming status as a prior possessor of the rice and asserting superior rights against the State of Idaho in that portion of the rice harvested from the U.S. Forest Service land.
Accepting the fact that 50% of the crop was grown on United States Forest Service land, the issue in this case is whether one who has admittedly trespassed and taken wild rice which does not belong to him can maintain an action for conversion based on an alleged status as a prior possessor.
Gissel claims the proceeds to the rice based solely on a prior possession theory.
Keeping in mind that Gissel's claim, as the trial court described it, rests solely on a claim of prior possession by a "thief," "[T]he essence of an action for conversion is the wrongful deprivation of property from the person entitled to possession.
The only claim that Gissel can demonstrate in the rice is that of one who "knowingly" and "wrongfully" took property which did not belong to him.
No conversion could have occurred when possession was taken from Gissel because that taking was pursuant to a valid search warrant, and therefore was not "an unauthorized and wrongful assumption of control, dominion or ownership...." Klam v. Koppel, 63 Idaho 171, 118 P.2d 729 (1941).
The subsequent disposition of the perishable property to prevent spoiling could not have been a conversion against Gissel because, at that time, he had neither possession nor any legal claim to the rice.
The court went on to conclude that: "It should need no citation of authorities to establish the proposition that no person can acquire title or right of possession to property of the state by the act of taking possession thereof illegally.
The U.S. Forest Service, claiming an interest in approximately one-half of the wild rice, refuses to release its interest to other than the Idaho Department of Fish and Game."
The law should not reward theft
