If a board of education in a, district fails to provide sufficient school privileges for all the youth of school age in the district, including the privilege of having high school branches offered at  some school within 4 miles of the district, including the privilege of having high school age in the district, or of having such branches made accessible to such children by transportation to or board and lodging within a district which offers such high school branches, under Section 7610-1, General Code, a mandatory duty rests upon the county board of education of the county to which such district belongs to perform the acts necessary to provide such high school branches or to make the same accessible to all children of school age within the district." 14 As written and correctly published in the Ohio Law Reporter and in the Northeastern Reporter, (141 N. E., 851), the third paragraph of the syllabus in the Masters case is as follows: 15 "(3) If a board of education in a district fails to provide sufficient school privileges for all the youth, of school age in the district, including the privilege of having high school branches offered at some school within 4 miles of the residence of each and every child of compulsory school age in the district, or of having such branches made accessible to such children by transportation to or board and lodging within a district which offers such high school branch's, under Section 7610-1, General Code, a mandatory duty rests upon the county board of education of the county to which such district belongs to perform the acts necessary to provide such high school branches or to make the same accessible to all children of school age within the district." 16 In the above paragraph of the syllabus in the Masters case this court held that it was the man  datory duty of the local board of education, or, in case of the failure of the local board to perform its duties, the mandatory duty of the county board of education, either to provide work in high school branches at some school within 4 miles of the plaintiff's residence, or to have such branches made accessible to the plaintiff's children by transportation to, or board and lodging within, 4 miles of the school wherein such high school branches are offered.
The duty of providing such high school work is enjoined upon the local board by Section 7764-1, General Code. Since the local board has failed to provide these high school branches, the same duty, or the duty of making such high school work accessible to children of compulsory school age, is imposed upon the-county board of education under section 7610-1, General Code. 18 This duty does not include that of furnishing the cost of room and board in Pandora, upon the facts in this immediate case, because the Riley  township board of education does maintain a high school within this particular district; hence Section 7749-2, General Code, does not apply.
If the township board fails to perform its mandatory duty under Section 7764-1, General Code, to provide work in high school branches within 4 miles of the residence of children of compulsory school age and of high school grade, the county board of education rests under a mandatory duty, either to provide such work in high school branches, or to make such work in high school branches accessible to the children by transportation.
It would be unjust to permit those who failed to perform a duty which was a matter of such public concern to retain the benefit bestowed upon them by the plaintiff in error. 24 It is urged that, as this court held in the Masters case, supra, that an action in mandamus lay upon the failure of the local board and of the county board to perform the duty of making high school branches accessible to children of school age, an action does not lie herein to collect reimbursement for the money expended by the relator in transporting his children to the high school.
The fact that, at a little different stage in the proceedings, mandamus would lie is no answer to the argument of the plaintiff here that, when he has expended money, time, and effort in performing a duty enjoined by statute upon the boards, he is entitled to receive a money reimbursement. 27 The demurrer will be overruled, and the judgment of the lower courts reversed. 28 Judgment reversed
