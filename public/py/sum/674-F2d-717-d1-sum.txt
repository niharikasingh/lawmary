The confrontation did not result in violence only because Ms. Williams did not take such steps and was otherwise powerless to stop the crew.
Despite this, the majority holds that no reasonable jury could find that the confrontation in Cathy Williams' driveway at 4:30 a. m. created a risk of violence.
The jury found a breach of the peace and this Court has no sound, much less compelling, reason to overturn that determination.
I would reverse the trial court and reinstate the jury's verdict
