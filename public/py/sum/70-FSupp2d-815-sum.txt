The following clauses offer some detail as to how legal rights will be affected by the Agreement: I understand that if I do file a lawsuit regarding a dispute arising out of or relating to my application or candidacy for employment, employment or cessation or employment, Circuit City may use this Agreement in support of its request to the court to dismiss the lawsuit and require me instead to use arbitration.
3 and 4, or, in the alternative, to dismiss this case entirely    pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Plaintiff and Defendant are parties to this Agreement requiring them to resolve this type of dispute through final and binding arbitration.
Plaintiff responds that the Agreement is invalid and unenforceable because it fails to comply with common law principles of contract law and because it attempts to limit Plaintiff's substantive rights and remedies.
In support of its Motion to Dismiss, Defendant submits a copy of the application Plaintiff signed on July 10, 1995 and a declaration from Pamela G. Parsons concerning that application and the Agreement.
Apparently because the Agreement requires final and binding arbitration of all employment disputes, Defendant asserts that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Complaint, or, alternatively, that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
In Asplundh Tree Expert Co. v. Bates, 71 F.3d 592 (6th Cir.1995), the Sixth Circuit held that: the exclusionary clause of   1 of the Arbitration Act should be narrowly construed to apply to employment contracts of seamen, railroad workers, and any other class of workers actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce in the same way that seamen and railroad workers are.
Therefore, the Agreement signed between Plaintiff and Defendant for the arbitration of all employment disputes falls within the type of contracts contemplated by the FAA.
Because we find no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the arbitration of her statutory claims and because Plaintiff fails to persuade us that Ohio would preclude the arbitration of her state-law claims, the Court concludes that Plaintiff should be held to her bargain unless (1) the traditional grounds for revocation of a contract exist in this case or (2) the Agreement fails to protect the substantive rights guaranteed by law.
Enforceability of the Agreement Plaintiff urges the Court to find the Agreement unenforceable, arguing that the Agreement is an unconscionable adhesion contract that limits Plaintiff's substantive rights and remedies under Title VII and Ohio Rev.Code   4112.
In view of the fact that Plaintiff signed the Agreement in Ohio and that her employment and termination occurred in Ohio, the Court will apply the common law of Ohio to this matter.
Dorsey v. Contemporary Obstetrics & Gynecology, Inc., 113 Ohio App.3d 75, 80, 680 N.E.2d 240, 243 (1996) (quoting Collins v. Click Camera & Video, Inc., 86 Ohio App.3d 826, 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294, 1299 (1993)); see also David L. Threlkeld & Co., Inc. v. Metallgesellschaft Ltd., 923 F.2d 245, 249 (2nd Cir.1991) (finding that a plaintiff must show "`unfairness, undue oppression, or unconscionability'" before a federal court will strike an arbitration agreement as a contract of adhesion) (citations omitted).
In support of her argument that the Agreement is a contract of adhesion, Plaintiff alleges that she was "forced" to sign the Agreement as part of the application in order to be considered for employment by Defendant.
Plaintiff further argues that the Agreement is unconscionable because it threatens to deny her the substantive rights and remedies provided by Title VII and Ohio Rev.Code   4112.
In contrast, Defendant asserts that the Agreement is not a contract of adhesion simply because Plaintiff had to sign it before she could be considered for employment.
In addition, Defendant argues that the Agreement signed by both Plaintiff and Defendant pursuant to the application was "clear and unambiguous" and could not lead to the type of surprise Plaintiff now asserts.
The Court finds Defendant's arguments persuasive, and we conclude that Plaintiff fails to show the unfairness or undue oppression necessary to support a finding that the Agreement amounted to an unconscionable contract of adhesion on a substantive or procedural basis.
We also find here that the balance of power between Plaintiff as an applicant and Defendant as a potential employer was not so disproportionate as to prevent a voluntary meeting of the minds on the issue of arbitration.
In response, Defendant argues that mutuality of obligation is maintained because Defendant can only modify or terminate the Agreement or the Rules and Procedures at a certain time each year and only upon 30 days' notice to each employee.
Moreover, Defendant argues that both Plaintiff and Defendant "made an objective manifestation of their intent to be bound" to arbitration of employment-related claims by signing the short but detailed Agreement in the application form (doc.
In addition, Plaintiff asserts that, because she signed the second application form after her employment began, an accompanying promise by Defendant to employ her cannot constitute consideration.
According to Defendant, Plaintiff was an at-will employee and Defendant was not required by law to arbitrate job termination issues related    to at-will employees.
In Johnson v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 148 F.3d 373, 378 (4th Cir.1998), the Fourth Circuit found that the same Circuit City arbitration agreement to be supported by adequate consideration: [B]oth parties in this case agreed to be bound by the arbitration process for the resolution of any claim required to be submitted to arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Agreement.
Therefore, we hold that the Dispute Resolution Agreement was supported by adequate consideration ... no consideration above and beyond the agreement to be bound by the arbitration process was required.
Likewise, in Michalski v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 177 F.3d 634, 636 (7th Cir.1999), the Seventh Circuit found that "Circuit City's promise to be bound by the arbitration process itself serves as mutual consideration here."
However, in this case, we initially find that the Agreement in which Plaintiff and Defendant promised to submit to final and binding arbitration of any employment-related claims is clear and unambiguous.
In bold-faced print, the language of the Agreement alerted Plaintiff that the Agreement affected her legal rights and that legal advice may be warranted.
Furthermore, Plaintiff refers to Hooters of America, Inc. v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933, 938-38 (4th Cir.1999), in which the Fourth Circuit held that an employer materially breached an arbitration agreement "by promulgating rules so egregiously unfair as to constitute a complete default of its contractual obligation to draft arbitration rules and to do so in good faith."
In the instant matter, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures also "severely curtail" Plaintiff's substantive rights and remedies.
Plaintiff points first to Rule 4 and argues that the time limit for initiating an arbitration proceeding is shorter than the time granted under Title VII or Ohio Rev.Code  4112 for initiating a judicial proceeding.
In response to Plaintiff's limited-discovery argument, Defendant notes that the Supreme Court allows reasonable limitations on discovery in arbitration of statutory discrimination claims.
Defendant further calculates that Plaintiff could actually recover a higher award of damages under the arbitration than Title VII.
Plaintiff argues that both the U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution express a public policy in favor of the right to a jury trial, and so mandatory arbitration agreements should not be enforced by the courts.
CONCLUSION Accordingly, since the Court holds (1) that this case falls within the coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act; (2) that the Agreement is broad enough to cover the disputes asserted in this case; and (3) that the Agreement is valid and enforceable, we hereby COMPEL arbitration of Plaintiff's claims.
As to Defendant's request that this Court stay the proceedings pending arbitration under   3 of the FAA or dismiss this matter pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6), we note that a court may dismiss a lawsuit when it determines that all of the issues involved are subject to arbitration.
Therefore, pursuant to the valid contract signed between Plaintiff and Defendant, we find that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted in Plaintiff's Complaint and that we may dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).
Thus, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and hereby DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff's action against Defendant.
