Art. V, ยง 3(b)(6), Fla. Const. The Eleventh Circuit certified the question:     Does a Florida tax certificate represent an interest in land for purposes of the Florida Uniform Commercial Code, so that Article 9 does not govern the creation of a security interest therein by virtue of ยง 679.104(10)[, Florida Statutes (1991)?]
" Because section 197.102(3) clearly defines a tax certificate as a first lien on real property, the plain language of sections 679.104(10) and 679.102(2) expressly excludes tax certificates (a lien on real property and a statutory lien) from the chapter governing secured transactions.
The appellee nevertheless argues that a tax certificate comes within the scope of article 9 when the certificate is offered as security for a loan.
If the question presented to us had been whether a note secured by a tax certificate is a transaction within the scope of article 9, our answer would be governed by this statutory provision.
Having answered the certified question, we return this case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for disposition.
