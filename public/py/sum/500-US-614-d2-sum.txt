The effect of today's decision (which logically must apply to criminal prosecutions) will be to prevent the defendant from doing so—so that the minority defendant can no longer seek to prevent an all-white jury, or to seat as many jurors of his own race as possible.
So in criminal cases, today's decision represents a net loss to the minority litigant.
When combined with our decision this Term in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991), which held that the party objecting to an allegedly race-based peremptory challenge need not be of the same race as the challenged juror, today's decision means that both sides, in all civil jury cases, no matter what their race (and indeed, even if they are artificial entities such as corporations), may lodge racialchallenge objections and, after those objections have been considered and denied, appeal the denials —with the consequence, if they are successful, of having the judgments against them overturned.
