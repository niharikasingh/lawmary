The question on this appeal is whether a lease which grants the tenant the right to terminate the agreement at a date of his choice creates a determinable life tenancy on behalf of the tenant or merely establishes a tenancy at will.
The courts below held that the lease created a tenancy at will permitting the current landlord to evict the tenant.
The court concluded that the original landlord leased the premises to the tenant "for a month-to-month term and that petitioner was entitled to terminate the lease upon the death of the lessor effective upon the expiration of the next succeeding monthly term of occupancy".
The express terms of a lease granting a life tenancy would fail, and a tenancy at will would result, only when livery of seisin, or any other requirement for a conveyance, had not been met (see, generally, Tiffany, op.
Because livery of seisin, like the ancient requirement for a seal, has been abandoned, commentators generally urge that there is no longer any reason why a lease granting the tenant alone the right to terminate at will, should be converted into a tenancy at will terminable by either party (Tiffany, op. cit., ยง 159; 1 American Law of Property, op. cit., ยง 3.30; Schoshinski, op. cit., ยง 2:16, pp 61, 62).
The case did not deal with a tenant's right to terminate a lease, but with the right of a tenant to renew a lease beyond its initial term "for such further time, after the expiration of said term, as said party of the second part (the lessee) shall choose or elect" (Western Transp. Co. v Lansing, supra, at p 502).
Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the petition dismissed.
