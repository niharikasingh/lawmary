First, I, for one, would not close the door upon the possibility that there are cases in which the doctrine of res judicata  must give way to what the Court of Appeals referred to as "overriding concerns of public policy and simple justice."
Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals found that those state-law claims were simply disguised federal claims; since respondents have not crosspetitioned from that judgment, their argument that this case should be remanded to state court should be itself barred by res judicata.
The dismissal of Brown I is res judicata not only as to all claims respondents actually raised, but also as to all claims that could have been raised.
See id., ยง 61.1, Comment e. Because they did not do so, I would hold the claims barred
