As the arbitrator and the district court found, the plain meaning of the term "substantially all" used in 29 U.S.C. ยง 1381 favors the Pension Fund. While what "substantially all" means in numerical terms may not be clear, what is clear is that it does not mean a bare majority.

PBGC, 539 F.Supp. 1025, 106061 (N.D.Ill.1982), aff'd on other grounds, 724 F.2d 1247 (7th Cir.1983). These reasons, taken together, suffice to dispose of this case
