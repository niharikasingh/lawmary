I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which denies compensation of fair market value for the easement.
My review of the statutes cited by the majority convinces me that they have not removed from the courts the traditional power to invoke the equitable doctrines which deal with fairness.
The case at bench assumes acquisition; the real issue deals with the conditions which the court may impose to protect that judicially declared easement.
The Power of the Court Acting in Equity The Court of Appeal correctly identified the nature of plaintiff's cause of action and the issue in this appeal when it wrote: "This is an appeal from an equitable decree which declared that plaintiffs had acquired an easement by prescription over the property of defendant."
Whether the trial court must order the plaintiffs to pay fair market value for the prescriptive  easement, as the Court of Appeal concluded, depends on the breadth of discretion which the court in equity enjoys.
Traditionally the courts have not imposed a condition that fair market value be paid before a prescriptive easement will be declared and protected.
I cite these only to stress that no reason abides in the history, concept or modern practice of equity which would so restrict the power of the court that it could not impose a requirement that fair market value be paid by the trespasser who is granted a prescriptive easement.
A requirement that plaintiffs pay fair market value for the land use given them is the least our society expects.
However, I would remand to the trial court for further proceedings to fix an amount of reasonable compensation to be paid by plaintiffs to defendant.
From that compensation damages, if any, sustained by plaintiff should be subtracted
