This matter is before the Court on plaintiffs’ motion to impose sanctions for defendants’ failure to answer certain interrogatories pursuant to Rule 37(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On December 12, 1974 plaintiffs served interrogatories on defendants, including the three interrogatories which are the subject of this motion.
Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions admits that defendants answered the interrogatories and therefore plaintiffs cannot validly express dissatisfaction with those answers by a motion for sanctions.
This Court finds that interrogatory answers which are limited to information affiant obtained from documents and which make no statement as to affiant’s personal knowledge of facts which the documents would have revealed are both incomplete and evasive.
 This Court is further convinced that defendants’ document destruction between May and November, 1974 makes it impossible for plaintiffs to obtain definitive answers to the interrogatories.
The destruction of documents before suit and defendant Murphy’s failure to answer interrogatories from personal knowledge renders useless plaintiffs’ attempt to obtain meaningful answers to interrogatories on the issues of identity of confidential informants and of information dissemination by the Intelligence Division. This Court therefore finds that plaintiffs are entitled to sanctions for defendants’ failure to answer interrogatories in a meaningful way.
(See Paragraph 97, plaintiffs’ complaint) CONCLUSION Accordingly, and for the reasons hereinbefore set forth, the Court finds and holds that plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing as to Paragraphs 82, 96, and 97 of the complaint.
