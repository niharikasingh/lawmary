This matter is before the Court on plaintiffs’ motion to impose sanctions for defendants’ failure to answer certain interrogatories pursuant to Rule 37(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
This Court finds that interrogatory answers which are limited to information affiant obtained from documents and which make no statement as to affiant’s personal knowledge of facts which the documents would have revealed are both incomplete and evasive.
 This Court is further convinced that defendants’ document destruction between May and November, 1974 makes it impossible for plaintiffs to obtain definitive answers to the interrogatories.
The destruction of documents before suit and defendant Murphy’s failure to answer interrogatories from personal knowledge renders useless plaintiffs’ attempt to obtain meaningful answers to interrogatories on the issues of identity of confidential informants and of information dissemination by the Intelligence Division.
This Court therefore finds that plaintiffs are entitled to sanctions for defendants’ failure to answer interrogatories in a meaningful way.
It is ordered that defendants have the burden of showing that they have not engaged in the activities therein described
