The landlord returned the check and in January, 1977, brought an action for summary process in the District Court of Peabody. The tenant answered and counterclaimed, alleging, inter alia, breach of the implied warranty of habitability.
The judge ruled further that the tenant is allowed to abate the rent from the date the landlord had notice of the breach of the warranty of habitability.
We must decide (1) whether a tenant must pay full rent without abatement when the landlord, acting without fault or bad faith, fails to maintain a dwelling in habitable condition and (2) whether the tenant's obligation to pay full rent persists until the landlord has had a reasonable time to repair the defect.
In Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), we found that social changes in landlord-tenant relations and legislative changes in landlord obligations and tenant remedies were inconsistent with medieval notions of  the lease as a conveyance of property.
The landlord argues that the existence of a serious defect in an apartment is a potential breach of the warranty; the breach becomes actual only after the landlord has been notified of the defect and has had a reasonable time to repair.
 Admittedly  a tenant must notify her landlord of defects as a prerequisite to a rent abatement, but the purpose of this requirement is not to assure the landlord a reasonable time to repair.
The tenant may now withhold rent without considering whether the landlord is at fault or is taking reasonable steps to repair.
Judgment affirmed
