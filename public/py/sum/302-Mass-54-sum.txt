The plaintiff, engaged in the business of controlling locations for billboards and signs and contracting with advertisers for the exhibition of their placards and posters, obtained from the defendant on October 9, 1934, a writing signed but not sealed by the defendant whereby the defendant "in Consideration of $25.00...agrees to give" the plaintiff "the exclusive right and privilege to maintain advertising sign one 10' x 25' on wall of building 3003 Washington St." in Boston, owned by the defendant, "for a period of one year with the privilege of renewal from year to year for four years more at the same consideration."
A lease of land conveys an interest in land, requires a writing to comply with the statute of frauds though not always a seal (Alfano v. Donnelly, 285 Mass. 554 , 557; Mayberry v. Johnson, 3 Green, 116), and transfers possession.

Nelson v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 270 Mass. 471 , 479.
The writing in question, however, giving the plaintiff the "exclusive right and privilege to maintain advertising sign...on wall of building," but leaving the wall in the possession of the owner with the right to use it for all purposes not forbidden by the contract and with all the responsibilities of ownership and control, is not a lease.

Subject to the right of a licensee to be on the land of another for a reasonable time after the revocation of a license, for the purpose of removing his chattels (Arrington v. Larrabee, 10 Cush. 512 ; Giles v. Simonds, 15 Gray 441 ; Delaney v. Root, 99 Mass. 546 ; McLeod v. Jones, 105 Mass. 403 ; Hill v. Cutting, 107 Mass. 596 ; Smith v. Hale, 158 Mass. 178 , 183; Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Torts, Sections 176, 177), it is of the essence of a license that it is revocable at the will of the possessor of the land.

And, differing from a lease of land for not more than seven years (Alfano v. Donnelly, 285 Mass. 554 , 557), a grant of an easement for as short a term as five years apparently requires a deed in order to create a legal interest.
