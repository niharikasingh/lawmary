The key factors in this case are Wayne County's reliance on this Court's decision in Poletown and the effect retroactive application will have on Wayne County, as well as other communities that relied on Poletown. In brief, Wayne County has spent approximately $50 million on the project at issue in this case in reliance on this Court's decision in Poletown. While I agree with the majority that Poletown improperly interpreted and applied the law, Wayne County's reliance on this Court's decision in Poletown is clear and I do not believe that Wayne County and its taxpayers should be penalized because the county followed this Court's guidance.
Therefore, while I concur with the majority in overruling Poletown, I dissent with respect to the retroactive application of the majority's decision
