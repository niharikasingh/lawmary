 The legislative history of 28 U. S. C. § 1367 provides powerful confirmation of JUSTICE GINSBURG'S interpretation of that statute.
It is helpful to consider in full the relevant portion of the House Report, which was also adopted by the Senate: "This section would authorize jurisdiction in a case like Finley [v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989)], as well as essentially restore the pre-Finley understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.
In diversity-only actions the district courts may not hear plaintiffs' supplemental claims when exercising supplemental jurisdiction would encourage plaintiffs to evade the jurisdictional requirement of 28 U. S. C. § 1332 by the simple expedient of naming initially only those defendants whose joinder satisfies section 1332's requirements and later adding claims not within original federal jurisdiction against other defendants who have intervened or been joined on a supplemental basis.
 Not only does the House Report specifically say that § 1367 was not intended to upset Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973), but its entire explanation of the statute demonstrates that Congress had in mind a very specific and relatively modest task—undoing this Court's 5-to-4 decision in Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989).
Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) ("In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which `represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen  involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation'" (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969); brackets in original)).
