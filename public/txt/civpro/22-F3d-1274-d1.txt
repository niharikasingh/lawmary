Although I share the majority's view that Levin and
Sklar's conduct fell far short of the ideal, I do not share
its belief that Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate in this
situation. Instead, I believe that, when a court finds that
an attorney has filed a meritorious complaint, the court
should not go on to inquire whether the attorney
conducted an adequate investigation prior to filing the
complaint. I therefore respectfully dissent.
Except for changes in the named plaintiffs and the
number of shares they owned, the complaint filed by
Levin and Sklar on behalf of the Garrs was identical to
the complaints filed by Malone on behalf of Greenfield
and Strunk. As the majority notes, the district court did
not dismiss the Strunk complaint, thereby implicitly
finding that on its face it stated a valid claim.
Presumably, had the district court not determined that
Levin and Sklar violated Rule 11, it would not have
dismissed the Garr complaint. Thus it is safe to assume
that the district court believed that the Garr complaint
on its face was meritorious.
In holding that the imposition of sanctions was
appropriate in this case, the majority relies on the
following statement in an opinion from a district court
in another circuit: "A shot in the dark is a sanctionable
event, even if it somehow hits the mark." Vista Mfg.,
Inc. v. Trac-4, Inc., 131 F.R.D. 134, 138
(N.D.Ind.1990).
[22 F.3d 1282]
  Though this statement
has the virtue of being colorful, as the basis of the
majority's reasoning it suffers from three flaws. First,
Vista does not support the majority's position; despite
the quoted statement the court imposed no sanctions.
Second, in relying on Vista the majority overlooks
apparent statements of law to the contrary by the Vista
court's own circuit, the Seventh, and by the Second
Circuit. Finally, the majority's conclusion that the Vista
rule is necessary to further the purposes of Rule 11 is the
product of an incomplete analysis of both the policies
animating Rule 11 and the impact of that rule on the
effectiveness of Rule 11. I shall address these latter two
points in turn.
The Seventh Circuit, a very aggressive court in terms of
enforcing Rule 11, see Lawrence C. Marshall et al., The
Use and Impact of Rule 11, 86 Nw.U.L.Rev. 943, 981-82
(1992), observed pre-Vista that for purposes of Rule 11
"[a]n attorney takes a frivolous position if he fails to
make a reasonable inquiry into facts (which later prove
false) or takes a position unwarranted by existing law or
a good faith argument for its modification." Magnus
Elecs. v. Masco Corp. of Indiana, 871 F.2d 626, 629 (7th
Cir.) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 891, 110
S.Ct. 237, 107 L.Ed.2d 188 (1989). See also Rush v.
McDonald's Corp., 966 F.2d 1104, 1122 n. 67 (7th
Cir.1992).
Moreover, in several cases the Second Circuit has
suggested that Rule 11 sanctions are inappropriate in
cases where, as here, some basis for a claim exists despite
the failure of an attorney to undertake an adequate pre-
filing investigation into whether that basis actually
existed. For example, in Calloway v. Marvel
Entertainment Group, 854 F.2d 1452, 1470 (2d
Cir.1988), rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom.
Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, 493
U.S. 120, 110 S.Ct. 456, 107 L.Ed.2d 438 (1989), Judge
Winter noted that
[i]n considering sanctions regarding a factual claim, the initial focus
of the district court should be on whether an objectively reasonable
basis for the claim was demonstrated in pretrial proceedings or at
trial. Where such a basis was shown, no inquiry into the adequacy
of the attorney's pre-filing investigation is necessary.
See also Greenberg v. Hilton Int'l Co., 870 F.2d 926,
934-35 (2d Cir.1989); Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d
1265, 1275 (2d Cir.1986) ("[R]ule 11 is violated only
when it is `patently clear that a claim has absolutely no
chance of success.'") (quoting Eastway Const. Corp. v.
City of New York, 762 F.2d 243, 254 (2d Cir.1985);
Wurzberg v. Lapid, 1993 WL 362374, *7, 1993
U.S.Dist. LEXIS 12799, *21 (S.D.N.Y.); Bleckner v.
General Accident Ins. Co., 713 F.Supp. 642, 650
(S.D.N.Y.1989).
Indeed, this court has remarked that we "have
interpreted [Rule 11's] language to prescribe sanctions,
including fees, only in the `exceptional circumstance' ...
where a claim or motion is patently unmeritorious or
frivolous." Doering v. Union County Bd. of Chosen
Freeholders, 857 F.2d 191, 194 (3d Cir.1988) (citation
omitted). Taken as a whole, these cases support the
notion that sanctions are inappropriate where, as here,
there was a reasonable basis for a complaint even if the
attorney filing it failed adequately to inquire into the
existence of that basis.
I believe the majority is mistaken in asserting that this
rule would frustrate the purposes of Rule 11. The
Supreme Court has stated that
the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings in the
District Court and thus, consistent with the Rule Enabling Act's
grant of authority, streamline the administration and procedure of
the federal courts.... Although the rule must be read in light of
concerns that it will spawn satellite litigation and chill vigorous
advocacy ... any interpretation must give effect to the rule's central
goal of deterrence.
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 393, 110
S.Ct. 2447, 2454 (1990). Similarly, the Advisory
Committee indicated that the purpose of Rule 11 is "to
discourage dilatory or abusive tactics and to help
streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous
claims or defenses." Notes of the Advisory Committee
on Rules, 1983 Amendment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, reprinted
in 97 F.R.D. 165, 200 (1983).
On the whole, the goals of deterring abuses of the
system and streamlining litigation would be better
served by the standard I [22 F.3d 1283] advocate. Because
the vast majority of "shots in the dark" will not hit their
target, almost all of them will be subject to sanction. I
find it difficult to believe that this slightly reduced
probability of sanction will encourage lawyers to take
blind shots. The deterrent function of Rule 11 to
prevent baseless filings will not be undermined by not
sanctioning when a complaint on its face does have
merit. As the Second and Seventh Circuits have
implicitly recognized, the best evidence of an inadequate
investigation will often be the fact that a complaint
states a frivolous claim. Without that evidence, the
inquiry becomes considerably more speculative.
Moreover, in cases in which the complaint states a
meritorious claim, we must consider whether we want
to encourage a secondary line of inquiry into the
adequacy of the attorney's research. I believe that
opening up such a line of attack, which will require
courts to engage in pure speculation in the worst case
and will lead to a waste of the court's time and resources
in the best case, will create a greater clog in the courts'
efficient functioning than will the failure to sanction the
rare case of the successful shot in the dark.
The majority is eager to sanction counsel in this case
because it believes sanctions are necessary to discourage
the indiscriminate filing of lawsuits. As I have pointed
out above, it is unlikely that the majority's rule would
have a greater effect in this regard than my standard.
Ironically, however, the majority's approach will
encourage the indiscriminate filing of motions for
sanctions. This case, in which the motion for sanctions
was prepared before defendants had even seen the Garr
complaint and was waiting at the courthouse for the
complaint to be filed, provides a perfect example of the
sort of behavior that the majority's reasoning will
encourage. Were the court to hold that facially
meritorious but inadequately investigated complaints
are not subject to sanction, defendants would have less
incentive to file such motions. Indeed, defendants under
such a regime would more likely be subject to sanction
for filing an unmeritorious motion for sanctions before
conducting an adequate investigation into the merit of
the complaint.
Simply stated, I believe that the majority, in its eagerness
to uphold sanctions against the inexcusable behavior by
the attorneys in this case, overlooks the fact that its
holding will frustrate rather than further the goals of
Rule 11. I would reverse the district court's imposition
of Rule 11 sanctions against Levin and Sklar.
