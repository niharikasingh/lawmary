The Court correctly holds that the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in patent
[535 U.S. 835] cases is "fixed with reference to that of the
district court," ante, at 829. It is important to note the
general rule, however, that the jurisdiction of the court
of appeals is not "fixed" until the notice of appeal is filed.
See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459
U.S. 56, 58-59 (1982) (per curiam) ("The filing of a
notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional
significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of
appeals and divests the district court of its control over
those aspects of the case involved in the appeal").
Thus, if a case began as an antitrust case, but an
amendment to the complaint added a patent claim that
was pending or was decided when the appeal is taken,
the jurisdiction of the district court would have been
based "in part" on 28 U. S. C. § 1338(a), and therefore §
1295(a)(1) would grant the Federal Circuit jurisdiction
over the appeal. Conversely, if the only patent count in a
multicount complaint was voluntarily dismissed in
advance of trial, it would seem equally clear that the
appeal should be taken to the appropriate regional court
of appeals rather than to the Federal Circuit. See
Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486
U.S. 800, 823-824 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring). Any
other approach "would enable an unscrupulous plaintiff
to manipulate appellate court jurisdiction by the timing
of the amendments to its complaint." Id., at 824. To the
extent that the Court's opinion might be read as
endorsing a contrary result by reason of its reliance on
cases involving the removal jurisdiction of the district
court, I do not agree with it.
I also do not agree with the Court's statement that an
interpretation of the "in whole or in part" language of §
1295(a)(1) to encompass patent claims alleged in a
compulsory counterclaim providing an independent
basis for the district court's jurisdiction would be a
"neologism" that would involve "an unprecedented feat
of interpretive necromancy," ante, at 833. For there is
well-reasoned precedent supporting precisely that
conclusion. See Aerojet-General Corp. v. Machine Tool
Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle Ltd., 895 F.2d 736, 742-743
(CA Fed. 1990) [535 U.S. 836] (en banc) (opinion of
Markey, C. J., for a unanimous court) (citing, e. g.,
Rengo Co. v. Molins Machine Co., 657 F.2d 535, 539
(CA3 1981); Dale Electronics, Inc. v. R. C. L.
Electronics, Inc., 488 F.2d 382, 390 (CA1 1973); Pioche
Mines Consol., Inc. v. Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co.,
206 F.2d 336, 336-337 (CA9 1953); Lion Mfg. Corp. v.
Chicago Flexible Shaft Co., 106 F.2d 930, 933 (CA7
1939)).1 I am nevertheless persuaded that a correct
interpretation of § 1295(a)(1) limits the Federal Circuit's
exclusive jurisdiction to those cases in which the patent
claim is alleged in either the original complaint or an
amended pleading filed by the [535 U.S. 837] plaintiff. In
my judgment, each of the three policies that the Court
has identified as supporting the "well-pleadedcomplaint"
rule governing district court jurisdiction, ante, at 831-
832, points in the same direction with respect to
appellate jurisdiction.
First, the interest in preserving the plaintiff's choice of
forum includes not only the court that will conduct the
trial but the appellate court as well. A plaintiff who has a
legitimate interest in litigating in a circuit whose
precedents support its theory of the case might omit a
patent claim in order to avoid review in the Federal
Circuit. In some cases that interest would be defeated by
a rule that allowed a patent counterclaim to determine
the appellate forum.
Second, although I doubt that a rule that enabled the
counterclaimant to be the occasional master of the
appellate forum "would radically expand" the number of
cases heard by the Federal Circuit, ante, at 832, we must
recognize that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
Circuit defined in § 1295(a)(1) does not comprise claims
arising under the trademark and copyright laws, which
are included in the district court's grant of jurisdiction
under § 1338(a).2 As the instant litigation demonstrates,
claims sounding in these other areas of intellectual
property law are not infrequently bound up with patent
counterclaims. The potential number of cases in which a
counterclaim might direct to the Federal Circuit appeals
that Congress specifically chose not to place within its
exclusive jurisdiction is therefore significant.
Third, the interest in maintaining clarity and simplicity
in rules governing appellate jurisdiction will be served
by limiting [535 U.S. 838] the number of pleadings that
will mandate review in the Federal Circuit. In his
opinion in Aerojet, Chief Judge Markey merely held that
a counterclaim for patent infringement that was
"compulsory" and not "frivolous" or "insubstantial"
sufficed to establish jurisdiction; he made a point of
noting that there was no assertion in the case that the
patent counterclaim at issue had been filed "to
manipulate the jurisdiction of [the Federal Circuit]." 895
F. 2d, at 738. The text of the statute, however, would
not seem to distinguish between that counterclaim and
those that are permissive, insubstantial, or manipulative,
and there is very good reason not to make the choice of
appellate forum turn on such distinctions. Requiring
assessment of a defendant's motive in raising a patent
counterclaim or the counterclaim's relative strength
wastes judicial resources by inviting "unhappy
interactions between jurisdiction and the merits."
Kennedy v. Wright, 851 F.2d 963, 968 (CA7 1988).
There is, of course, a countervailing interest in directing
appeals in patent cases to the specialized court that was
created, in part, to promote uniformity in the
development of this area of the law. But we have already
decided that the Federal Circuit does not have exclusive
jurisdiction over all cases raising patent issues.3
Christianson, 486 U. S., at 811-812.[535 U.S. 839]
Necessarily, therefore, other circuits will have some role
to play in the development of this area of the law. An
occasional conflict in decisions may be useful in
identifying questions that merit this Court's attention.
Moreover, occasional decisions by courts with broader
jurisdiction will provide an antidote to the risk that the
specialized court may develop an institutional bias.4
In sum, I concur in the Court's judgment and join Parts I
and II—A of its opinion.
