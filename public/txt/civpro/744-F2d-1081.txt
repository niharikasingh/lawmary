Dredge Technology Corp. and others appeal the
dismissal of their actions against Rogers-Olympic Corp.
for want of personal jurisdiction. We reverse.
Rogers-Olympic was served by means of the Louisiana
Long-Arm Statute. La.Rev.Stat.Ann. ยง 13:3201 (West
1968 & Supp. 1984). It is a foreign corporation that
operates a manufacturing plant in the State of
Washington. At that plant, steel castings were made and
then sold to Abex Corporation, which used them in the
manufacture of cylinders in California. The cylinders
ultimately served as parts of a dredge constructed by
Avondale Shipyard, Inc. in Louisiana. Bean Dredging
Corporation initiated this litigation with the claims that
the suppliers and manufacturers of the dredge were
negligent and strictly liable for its defects. Dredge
Technology and other defendants brought third-party
actions against Rogers-Olympic.
Rogers-Olympic, in the State of Washington, contracted
by purchase order through the mail with Abex for the
production of the steel castings in question. Abex used
the castings in manufacturing the cylinders in the State
of California. Rogers-Olympic had no knowledge of the
end-product into which the castings would be
incorporated. Rogers-Olympic never sold directly to a
company in Louisiana and did not know whether any
castings went to Louisiana, nor did Louisiana personnel
travel to Washington to negotiate with RogersOlympic.
The company did not solicit contracts or other
work in Louisiana and did not own property in
Louisiana.
Rogers-Olympic employs approximately 90 persons. It
had more than $8,000,000 in total sales in 1982. It
produces between 1,000 and 15,000 castings each year. It
has major customers in Pennsylvania, Oregon, Arizona,
California, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan,
and Texas. The customers in these states use RogersOlympic's
steel castings in rock crushers, mining
equipment, natural gas compressors, and water valves.
Rogers-Olympic also manufactures castings for armored
vehicles, and these castings are sold to the United States
Army. Mervyn Stithem, president of Rogers-Olympic
Corporation, testified that the castings for military
vehicles might end up anywhere in the United States.
When deposed, Mr. Stithem evinced an awareness that
even his company's commercial products, once they
entered the stream of commerce, might go virtually
anywhere:
Q. And once that casting leaves your plant in Washington, it could
really go anywhere in the United States, couldn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. It could be incorporated in just a variety of different types of
equipment or applications, couldn't it?
A. Yes.
[744 F.2d 1083] Q. And it could be located or used really in any state
in the United States, couldn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. Including the State of Louisiana?
A. Yes.
Rogers-Olympic moved to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction, and the district court dismissed. The issue
presented on this appeal is whether Rogers-Olympic had
sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Louisiana
for purposes of personal jurisdiction under the
Louisiana Long-Arm Statute and the Due Process
Clause.
EXERCISE OF IN PERSONAM
JURISDICTION UNDER LOUISIANA'S
LONG-ARM STATUTE
This court has considered the Louisiana Long-Arm
Statute in the past, and noted that it extends to the limits
of due process. "The Louisiana Long-Arm Statute is to
be interpreted liberally in favor of finding jurisdiction ...
and is to extend to the full limits of due process under
the fourteenth amendment." Quasha v. Shale
Development Corp., 667 F.2d 483, 486 (5th Cir.1982)
(citing, inter alia, Austin v. North American Forest
Products, 656 F.2d 1076, 1089 (5th Cir.1981); Standard
Fittings Co. v. Sapag, S.A., 625 F.2d 630, 639-41 (5th
Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 910, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68
L.Ed.2d 299 (1981)). Normally, there are two
components to the exercise of jurisdiction over a
nonresident: first, the state's long-arm statute must
apply; and second, its application in the particular case
must comport with the due process requirements of the
Fourteenth Amendment. DeMelo v. Toche Marine,
Inc., 711 F.2d 1260, 1264-1265 (5th Cir.1983). Given,
however, the synonymy between the limits of the
Louisiana Long-Arm Statute and those of due process, it
becomes necessary to consider only whether the exercise
of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports
with due process.
Due Process Requirements
For due process requirements to be met in a court's
assertion of personal jurisdiction, the nonresident
defendant must have certain "minimum contacts" with
the forum state "such that the maintenance of the suit
does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.'" International Shoe Co. v.
Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90
L.Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S.
457, 463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 342, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940));
DeMelo v. Toche Marine, Inc., 711 F.2d at 1270. To
make this determination, the court must first consider
whether the defendant purposefully availed itself of the
benefits and protection of the forum state's laws; and
second, whether the state has any special interest in
providing a forum for the suit, taking into consideration
the relative conveniences and inconveniences of the
parties. Austin v. North American Forest Products, 656
F.2d at 1089; Standard Fittings Co. v. Sapag, S.A., 625
F.2d at 641-43.
A. "Minimum Contacts" With Louisiana
Rogers-Olympic, a Washington corporation,
constructed steel castings used in the manufacture of
hydraulic cylinders by the Remco Division of Abex in
California. The cylinders, with the Rogers-Olympic steel
castings incorporated into them, were eventually used in
the dredge constructed by Avondale for Bean's use in
Louisiana. Appellants herein argue the "stream of
commerce" theory as developed in part in World-Wide
Volkswagen v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559,
62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980).
We note initially that this court has emphasized that the
number of contacts with the forum state is not
determinative of the "minimum contacts" test; rather,
"the contacts must support an inference that the
nonresident defendant purposefully availed himself of
the benefits of the forum state ... and ... even activities
outside one state can fulfill this requirement if they have
reasonably foreseeable consequences within the state."
Quasha v. Shale Development Corp., 667 F.2d 483, 488
(5th Cir.1982).[744 F.2d 1084] In expounding this
concept of purposeful availment of a state's laws, the
Supreme Court in World-Wide Volkswagen stated:
When a corporation "purposefully avails itself of the privilege of
conducting activities within the forum State," ... it has clear notice
that it is subject to suit there, and can act to alleviate the risk of
burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected
costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its
connection with the State. Hence, if the sale of a product of a
manufacturer or distributor such as Audi or Volkswagen is not
simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the
manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the
market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to
subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective
merchandise has there been the source of injury to its owners or to
others. The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due
Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation
that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the
expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum
State.
444 U.S. at 297-98, 100 S.Ct. at 567. In World-Wide
Volkswagen, the two defendants held not to be
amenable to Oklahoma jurisdiction were at the end of
the automobile's distribution system. The Court held
that due process would not permit Oklahoma to impose
jurisdiction over the local retailer of the automobile in
New York, or indeed over the New York automobile
wholesale distributor who sold to retailers in New York,
Connecticut, and New Jersey. Id. at 289, 298, 100 S.Ct.
at 563, 567. Yet, in dictum, the Court distinguished the
situation of the manufacturer, the entity placing the
product into the stream of commerce. Id. at 297-98, 100
S.Ct. at 567.
The Seventh Circuit has had occasion to construe and
apply the World-Wide Volkswagen dictum in Nelson v.
Park Industries, Inc., 717 F.2d 1120, 1125-26 (7th
Cir.1983), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 1278, 79
L.Ed.2d 682 (1984). In that case, a flannel shirt had
ignited when it came in contact with a cigarette lighter
flame, causing severe personal injuries to a minor. The
Hong Kong manufacturer was held to be subject to suit
in Wisconsin, because it had placed the shirt in the
stream of commerce. The court stated:
The World-Wide Volkswagen Court's recognition of a distinction
among the various entities that might compose a distribution
system of a product is pivotal to the decision in this case.... The
scope of the foreseeable market served by those defendants and of
the benefits those defendants derived from the sale of the product
was narrow. In contrast, the relevant scope is generally broader
with respect to manufacturers and primary distributors of products
who are at the start of a distribution system and who thereby serve,
directly or indirectly, and derive economic benefit from a wider
market. Such manufacturers and distributors purposely conduct
their activities to make their product available for purchase in as
many forums as possible. For this reason, a manufacturer or
primary distributor may be subject to a particular forum's
jurisdiction when a secondary distributor and retailer are not,
because the manufacturer and primary distributor have intended to
serve a broader market and they derive direct benefits from serving
that market.
Id.
Similarly, the Fifth Circuit upheld jurisdiction over a
foreign manufacturer of lighters that delivered them to a
single distributor in the United States for dissemination
throughout the country. In Oswalt v. Scripto, Inc., 616
F.2d 191 (5th Cir.1980), the court noted that the
manufacturer delivered millions of lighters to the
distributor with the understanding that the distributor
would sell the lighters to a customer with national retail
outlets. Id. at 199. "There is nothing in this record," the
court averred,
[744 F.2d 1085] to indicate that [the manufacturer] attempted in
any way to limit the states in which the lighters could be sold. To
the contrary, the record shows that [the manufacturer] had every
reason to believe its product would be sold to a nation-wide
market, that is, in any or all states.
Id. at 199-200.
Rogers-Olympic seeks to distinguish Oswalt v. Scripto
on the basis of numbers and argues: "In the instant case,
Rogers-Olympic manufactured and sold to Remco two
steel castings which were delivered either in the State of
Washington or California, with ... no indication
whatsoever as to their ultimate destination." If we count
only products causing the injury (whether economic or
physical) in a given case, then the problem in Oswalt v.
Scripto centered on a single lighter that was introduced
into the forum state. Instead, just as we considered the
millions of lighters in Oswalt, we must consider the
thousands of steel castings produced by Rogers-Olympic
and incorporated as component parts of products sold
throughout the nation.
Whereas in Oswalt v. Scripto the manufacturer
introduced millions of lighters into the stream of
commerce, in the instant case Rogers-Olympic
introduced thousands of steel castings into that stream.
The difference in numbers is not enough to convince us
that Rogers-Olympic had no interest in reaching as
broad a market as it possibly could. As in Oswalt v.
Scripto, the manufacturer here evidenced no attempt to
limit the states in which its castings would be sold and
used, albeit as a component part of a larger product.
Moreover, the mere fact of being a component-part
manufacturer affords Rogers-Olympic no solace. See
Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,
22 Ill.2d 432; 176 N.E.2d 761 (1961) (holding the
manufacturer of a defective valve used in a water heater
amenable to jurisdiction as a nonresident defendant),
cited with approval in Oswalt v. Scripto, 615 F.2d at
201-02. The fact remains that even though RogersOlympic
"did not originate the distribution system and
[does] not control it, [the company] did place the [steel
castings] in and move them along a stream of commerce
destined for retail sale [in finished products] throughout
the United States." Nelson v. Park Industries, Inc., 717
F.2d 1120, 1126 (7th Cir.1983), cert. denied, ___ U.S.
___, 104 S.Ct. 1278, 79 L.Ed.2d 682 (1984).
B. The Fairness of the Louisiana Forum
The second question to be determined under due
process analysis is whether it would be "fair" to require
Rogers-Olympic to defend this suit in Louisiana. When
a controversy is related to or "arises out of" a defendant's
contacts with the forum, the Supreme Court has said
that a "relationship among the defendant, the forum,
and the litigation" is the essential foundation of in
personam jurisdiction. Helicopteros Nacionales de
Colombia v. Hall, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 1872, 80
L.Ed.2d 404 (1984) (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S.
186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 2579, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977)).
The court must also examine "whether the forum state
has any special interest in exercising jurisdiction, and
whether the convenience of the parties favors litigating
in another state." Austin v. North American Forest
Products, 656 F.2d 1076 (5th Cir.1982). Upon review of
the record, these considerations lead to the conclusion
that it is both fair and reasonable to require RogersOlympic
to defend this suit in Louisiana. Because the
product was used in Louisiana, because the defects
surfaced in Louisiana, because the economic injury has
befallen a resident of Louisiana, and because the court
has not dismissed the remaining litigation in Louisiana,
that state has an interest in providing a forum for this
suit. Given the magnitude of the Rogers-Olympic
operations, the court is compelled to hold that it is not
unreasonably inconvenient for Rogers-Olympic to
defend the suit in Louisiana. The "maintenance of [this]
suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.'" International Shoe Co. v.
Washington, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158 (1945) [744
F.2d 1086] (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457,
463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 342, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940)).
We therefore hold that Rogers-Olympic is amenable to
jurisdiction under the Louisiana Long-Arm Statute and
the standards of due process.
REVERSED AND REMANDED.
