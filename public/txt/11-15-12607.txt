In 2005, plaintiff Christina L. Bazemore applied on the Internet for a credit
card issued by First Bank of Delaware (“FBD”). She charged several items on the
card but failed to pay in full. In 2008, Jefferson Capital System, LLC (“JSC”)
acquired all right, title and interest to Ms. Bazemore’s account. Eventually, Ms.
Bazemore sued JSC for an alleged violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (the “FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq. JSC moved to compel arbitration in
reliance on an arbitration clause said to have been contained in a cardholder
agreement between Ms. Bazemore and its predecessor-in-interest. The district
court concluded that Ms. Bazemore’s claim was outside the scope of the arbitration
clause and therefore denied JSC’s motion. We affirm, albeit on a different ground.
We hold that JSC failed to establish the existence of any agreement between Ms.
Bazemore and FBD beyond the agreement to pay whatever charges Ms. Bazemore
incurred by using the credit card.
I. FACTS
On November 18, 2005, Ms. Bazemore applied for an Imagine MasterCard
issued by FBD. It is undisputed that she did so over the Internet. But whether she
agreed to any terms and conditions in the course of doing so is unknown. The only
evidence is a declaration of Gregory Ryan, an individual employed at the time Ms.
Bazemore applied for her credit card by Atlanticus Services Corporation
(“Atlanticus”), which maintained records for such credit cards on behalf of FBD.
And while he stated in conclusory terms that Ms. Bazemore “accepted the terms
governing her account and opened the account” on or about November 18, 2005,
he did not assert that he has any personal knowledge on that score or produce any
documents to support that assertion. And those failures are quite important.
Today, virtually every Internet user is familiar with what have become
known as clickwrap agreements – “agreements [formed by] requiring a computer
user to ‘consent to any terms or conditions by clicking on a dialog box on the
screen in order to proceed with [a] . . . transaction.’” Hancock v. Am. Tel. & Tel.
Co., 701 F.3d 1248, 1255 (10thCir. 2012) (quoting Feldman v. Google, Inc., 513
F. Supp. 2d 229, 236 (E.D. Pa. 2007)). But there is no evidence of such an
electronic exchange between Ms. Bazemore and either FBD or Atlanticus. In other
words, there is no evidence that the Internet web page or pages that Ms. Bazemore
viewed, or upon which she applied for her Imagine MasterCard, displayed or
referred to any terms or conditions of the credit card she sought, much less that she
was required to consent to any such terms in order to obtain her credit card.
Mr. Ryan went on to say that a “Welcome Kit” that included a Bank Credit
Card Agreement (the “Cardholder Agreement”) “would have been sent” to Ms.
Bazemore about ten days after she applied for the credit card and that it “would
have” contained “[a] form of the Cardholder Agreement” attached to Mr. Ryan’s
declaration. The Cardholder Agreement attached to Mr. Ryan’s declaration (a)
contains the arbitration clause upon which JSC relies, and (b) states that the
Cardholder Agreement would become effective upon the earlier of the date the
card application was approved and the first date upon which credit was extended
on the account. But Mr. Ryan did not assert that the form of Cardholder
Agreement that “would have been sent” to Ms. Bazemore was the same as that
attached to his declaration. Indeed, he did not assert even that the form of
Cardholder Agreement that “would have been sent” to Ms. Bazemore contained an
arbitration clause of any kind, much less the clause found on the form attached to
his declaration. And although Mr. Ryan stated that he was “familiar with
Atlanticus record keeping systems” and that he reviewed certain “Atlanticus
business records” in preparing his declaration, he never stated that a Welcome Kit
containing a Cardholder Agreement actually was sent to Ms. Bazemore, merely
that one “would have been sent” as part of the company’s “regular and ordinary
practice.”
After receiving the credit card, Ms. Bazemore charged several items to the
card over approximately two-and-a-half months in 2005 and 2006. Although she
made several payments, she never paid her balance in full.
In 2013, Ms. Bazemore filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Georgia. See In re
Bazemore, No. 13-30476-EJC (Bankr. S.D. Ga.). On January 11, 2014, JSC,
which had acquired all right, title, and interest to Ms. Bazemore’s account, filed a
proof of claim for Ms. Bazemore’s alleged debt on her Imagine MasterCard
account in the bankruptcy proceeding.
On September 2, 2014, Ms. Bazemore brought this putative class action
against JSC in the Superior Court of Laurens County, Georgia. Her complaint
asserts that JSC violated the FDCPA by filing the proof of claim in Ms.
Bazemore’s bankruptcy proceeding because JSC’s claim on her alleged debt was
time barred. JSC removed the case to federal court on October 13, 2014, and then
moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pursuant to the arbitration clause
in the purported Cardholder Agreement on January 22, 2015. The district court,
after briefing and oral argument, denied JSC’s motion on the ground that Ms.
Bazemore’s FDCPA claim fell outside the scope of the arbitration clause that JSC
asserted bound Ms. Bazemore. Bazemore v. Jefferson Capital Sys., LLC, No. 14-
cv-115 (DHB), 2015 WL 2220057 (S.D. Ga. May 11, 2015). JSC timely appealed
pursuant to 9 U.S.C. Section 16(a).
II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
We review de novo a district court’s denial of a motion to compel
arbitration. Collardo v. J. & G. Transport, Inc., No. 15-14635, 2016 WL 1594581,
at *2 (11th Cir. Apr. 21, 2016). We may affirm the district court’s decision on any
ground supported by the record. Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca
Pharms., LP, 634 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir. 2011).
B. Defendant Failed to Prove the Existence of an Arbitration Agreement
If there is an arbitration agreement governing this dispute, it is governed by
the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., which “embodies a
liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.” Caley v. Gulfstream
Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted).
Indeed, we have recognized that the FAA creates a “presumption of arbitrability”
such that “any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved
in favor of arbitration.” Dasher v. RBC Bank (USA), 745 F.3d 1111, 1115-16
(11th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 144 (2014); see
Granite Rock Co. v. Int’l Bhd. Of Teamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 301, 130 S. Ct. 2847,
2858-59 (2010). Nonetheless, “while doubts concerning the scope of an arbitration
clause should be resolved in favor of arbitration, the presumption does not apply to
disputes concerning whether an agreement to arbitrate has been made.” Dasher,
745 F.3d at 1116 (quotation marks omitted); see Granite Rock, 561 U.S. at 301,
130 S. Ct. at 2858-59 (directing courts to “apply[] the presumption of arbitrability
only” to “a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement”). The threshold
question of whether an arbitration agreement exists at all is “simply a matter of
contract.” First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S. Ct.
1920, 1924 (1995). Absent such an agreement, “a court cannot compel the parties
to settle their dispute in an arbitral forum.” Klay v. All Defendants, 389 F.3d
1191, 1200 (11th Cir. 2004).
Here, plaintiff argues that JSC failed to establish that she ever entered into
an arbitration agreement with JSC’s predecessor-in-interest. This requires that we
address the law governing the onus of proof with respect to the existence of an
agreement to arbitrate.
Prior to First Options of Chicago, Chastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., 957
F.2d 851 (11th Cir. 1992), and other cases in this Circuit and its predecessor, the
Fifth Circuit, had held that a party resisting a motion to compel arbitration on the
ground that no arbitration agreement existed could not succeed absent “‘an
unequivocal denial that the agreement had been made . . . and some evidence . . . to
substantiate the denial.’” Id. at 854 (alterations omitted) (quoting T & R Enters.,
Inc. v. Cont’l Grain Co., 613 F.2d 1272, 1278 (5th Cir. 1980)). A year after
Chastain, in Wheat, First Securities, Inc. v. Green, 993 F.2d 814 (11th Cir. 1993),
we reiterated that “[t]he party seeking to avoid arbitration must unequivocally deny
that an agreement to arbitrate was reached and must offer some evidence to
substantiate the denial.” Id. at 817 (quotation marks omitted).
The Supreme Court decided First Options of Chicago two years after Green.
It there explained that “[w]hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a
certain matter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary state-law principles
that govern the formation of contracts.” 514 U.S. at 944, 115 S. Ct. at 1924.
Since then, this Circuit repeatedly has emphasized that “state law generally
governs whether an enforceable contract or agreement to arbitrate exists.” Caley,
428 F.3d at 1368 (emphasis added) (citing Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 492 n.9,
107 S. Ct. 2520, 2527 (1987)). For example, in Caley we said that “in determining
whether a binding [arbitration] agreement arose between the parties, courts apply
the contract law of the particular state that governs the formation of contracts.” Id.
Even more recently, in Dasher, we explained that “when determining whether an
arbitration agreement exists, ‘courts generally . . . should apply ordinary state-law
principles that govern the formation of contracts,’” and there applied North
Carolina law to determine that the parties had not entered into an arbitration
agreement. 745 F.3d at 1116 (quoting First Options of Chicago, 514 U.S. at 944,
115 S. Ct. at 1924). Moreover, in the nearly quarter-century since Chastain and
Green, no published decision of this Court has cited either case for the proposition
that the burden is on the party denying the existence of an arbitration agreement to
deny its existence “unequivocally” and substantiate that denial with proof.1
As the foregoing demonstrates, we consistently have held that state law
governs the issue of the existence of an agreement to arbitrate under the FAA since
First Options of Chicago was decided. Here, plaintiff asserts, and defendant
appears to agree, that Georgia law applies. Appellee’s Br. at 14; see Appellant’s
Reply Br. at 8 (relying on Georgia substantive contract law). Accordingly, we
apply Georgia law to determine whether Ms. Bazemore and FBD entered into an
arbitration agreement.
In Georgia, “[t]o constitute a valid contract, there must be parties able to
contract, a consideration moving to the contract, the assent of the parties to the
terms of the contract, and a subject matter upon which the contract can operate.”
Ga. Code Ann. § 13-3-1. The element of assent requires “‘(a) a meeting of the
minds (b) on the essential terms of the contract.’” Regan v. Stored Value Cards,
Inc., 85 F. Supp. 3d 1357, 1362 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (quoting John K. Larkins, Jr., Ga.
Contracts Law and Litigation § 3:2 (2d ed.)), aff’d sub nom. Reagan v. Stored
Value Cards, Inc., 608 F. App’x 895 (11th Cir. 2015). The existence and terms of
a contract must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Wallace v. Triad
Sys. Fin. Corp., 442 S.E.2d 476, 478 (Ga. Ct. App. 1994); Gentry v. Beverly
Enters.-Ga., Inc., 714 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1229 (S.D. Ga. 2009). “The party
asserting the existence of a contract has the burden of proving its existence and its
terms.” Jackson v. Easters, 379 S.E.2d 610, 611 (Ga. Ct. App. 1989); see Yates v.
CACV of Colo., 693 S.E.2d 629, 634 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010) (“As the party seeking
to enforce the alleged arbitration agreement, CACV bore the burden of proving the
existence of such a valid and enforceable agreement.”).
JSC attempted to satisfy this burden by the declaration of Gregory Ryan, an
“executive correspondence manager” at Atlanticus. But Mr. Ryan’s declaration is
woefully inadequate.
First, he states that he “was able to ascertain that Plaintiff had applied for the
[credit card] over the internet” and that plaintiff “accepted the terms governing her
account.” But Mr. Ryan does not explain how he knows this, nor does he
substantiate the claim with documentary proof. More fundamentally, there is no
indication what “the terms governing her account” were, and there is no evidence
concerning what, if any, clickwrap agreement appeared on plaintiff’s computer
screen when she applied for her credit card. The most that can be said is that she at
least implicitly agreed to pay the card issuer or its assignee for any goods or
services she charged to the card. But that does nothing to advance JSC’s argument
in favor of compelling arbitration. JSC has presented no competent evidence as to
what, if any, terms plaintiff agreed to when ordering her credit card. In particular,
it has presented no competent evidence that she entered into any relevant
arbitration agreement. Accordingly, it cannot compel her to arbitrate on the basis
of such terms.
Second, Mr. Ryan says that a Welcome Kit including a Cardholder
Agreement with an arbitration clause “would have been sent to Plaintiff” within ten
days of her online application in the ordinary course of Atlanticus’s business.
(Emphasis added.) JSC further argues that it is entitled to a presumption under the
“mailbox rule”2 that plaintiff received the Welcome Kit. But Mr. Ryan has no
personal knowledge that a Welcome Kit in fact was sent to Ms. Bazemore. Nor
does he claim that he reviewed any records showing that a Welcome Kit was sent
to her. Accordingly, because JSC has presented no competent evidence that a
Welcome Kit containing the arbitration agreement it now seeks to enforce ever was
mailed to Ms. Bazemore, and it cannot compel her to arbitrate pursuant to any such
agreement. Cf. Williams v. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., No. 09-22890-CIV, 2010
WL 62605, at *10 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 5, 2010) (denying a motion to compel arbitration
where “there [was] no evidence that [plaintiff] ever received the Agreement or was
made aware of it in any documents . . . or in any text messages relaying her bills”).
Third, even assuming that the evidence established that a Welcome Kit was
sent to Ms. Bazemore, it does not show that the Welcome Kit included the
arbitration clause upon which JSC relies or any relevant variant. Mr. Ryan
purports to attach to his declaration “[a] form of the Cardholder Agreement that
would have been sent to Plaintiff” as evidence of the language contained in the
arbitration clause JSC seeks to enforce. (Emphasis added.) He does not, however,
attach a copy of the particular agreement that allegedly “would have been” mailed
to plaintiff. And that is not an accident -- JSC conceded during oral argument that
it did not “have an exact copy of what was sent” to plaintiff. Nor does Mr. Ryan
say that the language of the form of agreement attached to his declaration is
identical to anything that “would have been sent” to Ms. Bazemore. This
distinction is critical. As plaintiff pointed out during oral argument, the forms of
such agreements change frequently, often in response to changes in the substantive
law. There is no way of knowing whether the arbitration language contained in the
form of the agreement attached to Mr. Ryan’s declaration, or any relevant variant
of it, appeared in the form allegedly mailed to Ms. Bazemore. Accordingly, JSC
did not meet its burden of proving that plaintiff assented to the “essential terms of
the contract” for the simple reason that the terms of exactly what, if anything, Ms.
Bazemore agreed to when she applied for the credit card are unknown. See
Herssein Law Grp. v. Reed Elsevier, Inc., 594 F. App’x 606, 608 (11th Cir. 2015)
(“‘It is a basic tenet of contract law that a party can only advance a claim of breach
of written contract by identifying and presenting the actual terms of the contract
allegedly breached.’”) (quoting Harris v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 198 F.3d 245
(6th Cir.1999)); see also Burgess v. Religious Tech. Ctr., Inc., 600 F. App’x 657,
664 (11th Cir. 2015) (affirming holding that plaintiff failed to state a breach of
contract claim under Georgia law when contract was not attached to complaint).
It is true, as JSC argues, that courts routinely enforce unsigned service
contracts – including credit card contracts – where the contract is sent to a recipient
who thereafter demonstrates his or her assent to its terms by using the service
provided. And there is no dispute here that plaintiff received and used a credit card
provided by JSC’s predecessor-in-interest. But the cases on which JSC relies all
are distinguishable on the grounds that the parties seeking to enforce contractual
provisions in those cases provided the court with (1) competent evidence that the
contract was sent to the plaintiff and (2) a copy of the actual contract they were
seeking to enforce.
Here, defendant has done neither. Nor has defendant
provided evidence concerning the contents of any clickwrap agreement to which
plaintiff assented while ordering her credit card online. Accordingly, defendant
has not met its burden under Georgia law to prove the existence and terms of the
arbitration agreement it seeks to enforce. Its motion to compel arbitration should
have been denied.4
 See Yates, 693 S.E.2d at 634-35 (holding that movant failed to
prove existence of valid arbitration agreement when “[movant] did not submit a
copy of any credit card application or agreement executed by [cardholder]; nor did
it submit an affidavit or other evidence showing the date [cardholder] entered into
a credit agreement with MBNA and that the photocopied terms and conditions
[attached to the motion to compel arbitration] represented the terms and conditions
in effect for all MBNA credit agreements at that time”; and movant also “failed to

cv-3438 (RWS), Decl. of Mary Kay Schultz [DI 2-1] at ¶¶ 11-12 & Ex. E (N.D. Ga. Oct. 29,
2010) (stating that a “Subscriber Agreement” containing an arbitration provision “was mailed to
Plaintiff” and attaching a copy of the agreement); Honig v. Comcast of Ga. I, LLC, No. 07-cv-
1839 (TCB), Decl. of James Andrew Macke [DI 8-2] at ¶¶ 5-6 & Ex. A (N.D. Ga. Aug. 23,
2007) (stating that defendant “provided [plaintiff] with the Welcome Kit” containing a
“Subscriber Agreement” that included an arbitration provision “when her [cable] service was
installed” and attaching a copy of the agreement); Sanders v. Comcast Cable Holdings, LLC, No.
07-cv-918 (VMC), Decl. of Bill Ferry [DI 9-2] at ¶¶ 14-17 & Ex. B (M.D. Fla. Oct. 19, 2007)
(stating that an “Arbitration Agreement was mailed” to four plaintiffs and attaching a copy of the
agreement).
offer any evidence showing . . . that the amendments [to the credit card application
containing the arbitration clause] were sent to [the cardholder]”).
C. The Motion To Compel Arbitration Should Have Been Denied Without
Trial
JSC contended during oral argument that we should remand for trial if we
conclude that it failed to prove the existence of the alleged arbitration agreement.
It relies on Section 4 of the FAA, which states that “[i]f the making of the
arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in
issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.” 9 U.S.C. § 4. Thus,
it would have us hold, essentially, that a party cannot lose a motion to compel
arbitration for failure to prove that an arbitration agreement exists without being
afforded a second bite at the apple – an opportunity to prove the agreement’s
existence at trial. This we decline to do.
Although we have not addressed in a published opinion the standard for
determining whether a trial is necessary to determine the existence of an arbitration
agreement, several of our sister circuits have likened the standard to one for
summary judgment. The Third Circuit, for example, has explained that “‘[o]nly
when there is no genuine issue of fact concerning the formation of the [arbitration]
agreement should the court decide as a matter of law that the parties did or did not
enter into such an agreement.’” SBRMCOA, LLC v. Bayside Resort, Inc., 707 F.3d
267, 271 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Par–Knit Mills, Inc. v. Stockbridge Fabrics Co.,
636 F.2d 51, 54 & n.9 (3d Cir. 1980)). The Tenth Circuit stated similarly in a
recent opinion that “[w]hen it’s apparent from a quick look at the case that no
material disputes of fact exist it may be permissible and efficient for a district court
to decide the arbitration question as a matter of law through motions practice . . . .
In these circumstances, the [FAA’s] summary trial can look a lot like summary
judgment.” Howard v. Ferrellagas Partners, L.P., 748 F.3d 975, 978 (10th Cir.
2014); accord Neb. Mach. Co. v. Cargotec Solutions, LLC, 762 F.3d 737, 743 (8th
Cir. 2014).
We agree with our sister circuits that a summary judgment-like standard is
appropriate and hold that a district court may conclude as a matter of law that
parties did or did not enter into an arbitration agreement only if “there is no
genuine dispute as to any material fact” concerning the formation of such an
agreement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is not “‘genuine’ if it is unsupported
by the evidence or is created by evidence that is ‘merely colorable’ or ‘not
significantly probative.’” Baloco v. Drummond Co., 767 F.3d 1229, 1246 (11th
Cir. 2014) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.
Ct. 2505, 2511 (1986)), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 410 (2015). “This court has
consistently held that conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have
no probative value” for a party resisting summary judgment. See Leigh v. Warner
Bros., 212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted).
Here, the competent evidence offered by JSC is insufficient to raise a
genuine issue of fact as to the existence of an arbitration agreement between its
predecessor-in-interest and Ms. Bazemore. As explained above, JSC provides no
competent evidence that an arbitration agreement ever was sent to plaintiff. Nor
does JSC provide evidence that the terms it seeks to enforce were contained in the
form of any agreement that “would have been sent” to Ms. Bazemore. At best,
JSC’s statement that “a form” of the arbitration agreement attached to its motion –
a form of unknown terms of which it concededly has no copy – “would have been
sent” to plaintiff is no more than a “mere scintilla of evidence” in support of its
position, insufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact. See Baloco, 767
F.3d at 1246.
The Court acknowledges that plaintiff, too, has provided almost no
evidentiary support for her contention that she never entered into an arbitration
agreement with FBD. Plaintiff has not, for example, submitted an affidavit
swearing under oath that she never received the Welcome Kit referenced in Mr.
Ryan’s declaration. But it is defendant’s burden under Georgia law to prove the
existence and terms of the contract it wishes to enforce. Moreover, entry of
summary judgment is appropriate “against a party who fails to make a showing
sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and
on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986).
As defendant offered no competent evidence to demonstrate the existence of
a genuine issue of material fact concerning the existence of an arbitration
agreement, its motion to compel arbitration must be denied as a matter of law
without the need for a trial.
III. CONCLUSION
We AFFIRM the denial of JSC’s motion to compel arbitration and stay
proceedings, albeit on different grounds than those reached by the district court.
